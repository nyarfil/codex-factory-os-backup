## Functions

### Curves & Surfacing

#### `Curve.Blend(start: CurveBlendEndpoint, end: CurveBlendEndpoint): NurbsCurve3D` — Create an exact G1 blend curve between two directed endpoints.

The returned curve is a cubic non-rational `NurbsCurve3D`: ForgeCAD converts the endpoint positions and tangents into Bezier control points, so the curve can feed `sweep` and exact surface boundaries through the existing `nurbs` IR rather than a sampled polyline.

```js
const rail = Curve.Blend(
  { point: [0, 0, 0], tangent: [1, 0, 0], weight: 0.8 },
  { point: [40, 20, 8], tangent: [0, 1, 0], weight: 0.8 },
);
const tube = sweep(circle2d(2), rail);
```

**`CurveBlendEndpoint`**
- `point: Vec3` — Endpoint position.
- `tangent: Vec3` — Tangent direction at this endpoint. Magnitude is ignored.
- `weight?: number` — Tangent reach relative to the endpoint chord length. Default 1.

#### `Curve.BlendG2(start: CurveBlendG2Endpoint, end: CurveBlendG2Endpoint): NurbsCurve3D` — Create an exact G2 blend curve between two directed endpoints.

This is the curvature-aware companion to `Curve.Blend()`. It returns a degree-5 non-rational `NurbsCurve3D` that matches endpoint position, tangent direction, and optional curvature/second-derivative vectors.

```js
const rail = Curve.BlendG2(
  { point: [0, 0, 0], tangent: [1, 0, 0], curvature: [0, 0.02, 0] },
  { point: [50, 20, 0], tangent: [0, 1, 0], curvature: [-0.02, 0, 0] },
);
```

**`CurveBlendG2Endpoint`** extends CurveBlendEndpoint
- `curvature?: Vec3` — Optional endpoint curvature/second-derivative vector. Default is zero.

#### `Curve.Bridge(options: CurveBridgeOptions): NurbsCurve3D` — Bridge two existing curve endpoints with inferred tangent or curvature continuity.

This is the Onshape-style "select two curves and bridge them" primitive: ForgeCAD reads the endpoint positions, tangent directions, and NURBS curvature from the selected curves so callers do not hand-author tangent vectors. Use `continuity: 'G1'` for a cubic tangent bridge or the default `G2` for a quintic curvature bridge.

```js
const leftRim = Curve.Fit([[20, -12, 0], [0, -18, 2], [-30, -14, 1]]);
const rightRim = Curve.Fit([[20, 12, 0], [0, 18, 2], [-30, 14, 1]]);
const roundedNose = Curve.Bridge({
  from: { curve: leftRim, at: 'end' },
  to: { curve: rightRim, at: 'end' },
  continuity: 'G2',
});
```

**`CurveBridgeOptions`**

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `from` | `CurveBridgeEndpoint` | Endpoint where the bridge starts. |
| `to` | `CurveBridgeEndpoint` | Endpoint where the bridge ends. |
| `continuity?` | `CurveBridgeContinuity` | Continuity target. Default `G2`. |
| `weight?` | `number` | Tangent reach relative to bridge chord. Default 0.6. |

**`CurveBridgeEndpoint`**
- `curve: CurveTrimInput` — Existing curve endpoint to bridge from or to.
- `at?: CurveBridgeEndpointAt` — Which endpoint of the curve to use. Default is `end`.
- `weight?: number` — Tangent reach relative to bridge chord. Overrides `CurveBridgeOptions.weight` for this side.

#### `Curve.Arc(options: CurveArcOptions): NurbsCurve3D` — Create an exact circular 3D arc from start, end, and start tangent.

The returned curve is a rational quadratic `NurbsCurve3D`, split into stable spans when needed, so it can feed `sweep` without sampling the authoring intent away.

```js
const rail = Curve.Arc({
  start: [40, 0, 0],
  end: [0, 40, 0],
  tangent: [0, 1, 0],
});
const tube = sweep(circle2d(2), rail);
```

**`CurveArcOptions`**
- `start: Vec3` — Arc start point.
- `end: Vec3` — Arc end point.
- `tangent: Vec3` — Tangent direction at the start point. Magnitude is ignored.

#### `Curve.Line(start: Vec3, end: Vec3): NurbsCurve3D` — Create an exact straight 3D NURBS line segment.

```js
const rail = Curve.Line([0, 0, 0], [80, 0, 15]);
const rib = sweep(circle2d(2), rail);
```

#### `Curve.Nurbs(points: Vec3[], options?: NurbsCurve3DOptions): NurbsCurve3D` — Create an exact NURBS 3D curve from control points, weights, knots, and degree.

```js
const rail = Curve.Nurbs([[0, 0, 0], [30, 4, 12], [60, -4, 12], [90, 0, 0]]);
const tube = sweep(circle2d(2), rail);
```

**`NurbsCurve3DOptions`**

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `degree?` | `number` | Polynomial degree (default 3 = cubic). Must be ≥ 1. |
| `weights?` | `number[]` | Rational weights, one per control point (default: all 1.0 = non-rational). |
| `knots?` | `number[]` | Knot vector (default: uniform clamped). Must have length = controlPoints.length + degree + 1. |
| `closed?` | `boolean` | Whether the curve is closed/periodic (default false). |

#### `Curve.Fit(points: Vec3[], options?: CurveFitOptions): NurbsCurve3D` — Fit a non-rational NURBS curve that interpolates every input point.

This is global B-spline interpolation, not approximate curve reduction: ForgeCAD computes chord-length parameters, averaged clamped knots, solves the control points, then verifies the interpolation residual against `tolerance`. With `{ closed: true }` the fit is standard periodic B-spline interpolation: the curve loops smoothly from the last point back to the first (do not repeat the first point at the end).

```js
const rail = Curve.Fit(
  [[0, 0, 0], [20, 8, 12], [50, -4, 18], [80, 0, 0]],
  { degree: 3, tolerance: 0.001 },
);
const tube = sweep(circle2d(2), rail);

// Closed loop through four points — no duplicated closing point
const loop = Curve.Fit(
  [[30, 0, 0], [0, 30, 0], [-30, 0, 0], [0, -30, 0]],
  { closed: true },
);
```

**`CurveFitOptions`**
- `degree?: number` — Polynomial degree. Default is cubic, reduced automatically for short point lists.
- `tolerance?: number` — Maximum allowed interpolation residual in model units. Default 1e-7.
- `closed?: boolean` — Interpolate a closed periodic loop through the points. The loop closes from the last point back to the first automatically — do not repeat the first point at the end.

#### `Curve.ProjectOnSurface(curve: NurbsCurve3D | Vec3[], sheet: Sheet, options?: CurveProjectOnSurfaceOptions): NurbsCurve3D` — Project a curve onto a `Sheet` along the surface normal and return the exact NURBS foot curve.

This is the "drape a curve onto a surface" primitive: each sampled point of the source curve is inverted onto the sheet (closest surface point via the analytic jet), and the foot points are fitted with `Curve.Fit`. Use it to trace a planned trim line, seam, or graphic onto a freeform panel, then sweep or trim from the real on-surface curve.

The source may be an exact `NurbsCurve3D` or a `Vec3[]` polyline (for example a placed 2D path). With `{ closed: true }` the result is a periodic loop, for draping a closed boundary onto the sheet. Set `maxGap` to require that every sample lands within a distance of the surface; the call throws if any sample misses (no silent fallback).

```js
const panel = Surface.Net().cage(cage);
const guide = Curve.Line([-20, 0, 30], [20, 0, 30]);
const seam = Curve.ProjectOnSurface(guide, panel);
const bead = sweep(circle2d(0.6), seam);
```

**`CurveProjectOnSurfaceOptions`**

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `samples?` | `number` | Coarse samples taken along the source curve before per-sample projection. Default 64. |
| `refineIterations?` | `number` | Newton refinement iterations of the (u, v) foot-point per sample. Default 8. |
| `tolerance?` | `number` | Interpolation tolerance passed to Curve.Fit for the result. Default 1e-4. |
| `closed?` | `boolean` | Fit a closed periodic loop (use when the source curve is a closed loop). Default false. |
| `maxGap?` | `number` | Max allowed projection gap; throws if any sample lands farther than this from the surface foot. Default Infinity (no gate). |

#### `Curve.Intersect(sheetA: Sheet, sheetB: Sheet, options?: CurveIntersectOptions): NurbsCurve3D[]` — Intersect two `Sheet` surfaces and return the exact NURBS intersection branches.

This is curve-following surface-surface intersection (SSI): a transversal marcher follows each intersection branch using the analytic surface jets (the intersection tangent is `cross(normalA, normalB)`), converging every step onto both surfaces, then fits each branch with `Curve.Fit`. A single pair of sheets can intersect in several disjoint curves, so the result is an array (empty when the sheets do not meet).

Only transversal intersections (where the surfaces cross and the intersection tangent `cross(normalA, normalB)` is well defined) are detected. A tangential / grazing contact (where the surface normals are parallel and the tangent is undefined) is not marched and may be reported as no-intersection (an empty array) — tangential SSI is a documented follow-on, not a silent fallback.

```js
const wing = Surface.Net().cage(wingCage);
const rib = Surface.Net().cage(ribCage);
const [seam] = Curve.Intersect(wing, rib);
const weld = sweep(circle2d(0.5), seam);
```

**`CurveIntersectOptions`**

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `samples?` | `number` | Grid resolution per axis for seeding the marcher (samples x samples on sheetA). Default 48. |
| `step?` | `number` | Marching step as a fraction of sheetA's average sample spacing. Default 0.5. |
| `refineIterations?` | `number` | Newton iterations to converge each marched point onto both surfaces. Default 12. |
| `tolerance?` | `number` | Convergence/coincidence tolerance in model units. Default 1e-4. |
| `fitTolerance?` | `number` | Fit tolerance passed to Curve.Fit. Default 1e-3. |

#### `Curve.Trim<T extends CurveTrimInput>(curve: T, start: number, end: number): CurveTrimOutput<T>` — Extract an exact curve segment from normalized parameter `start` to `end`.

`NurbsCurve3D` inputs are trimmed with exact knot insertion/subdomain extraction. Polyline point arrays are trimmed by arclength over their exact line segments. Sampled `Curve3D` splines are rejected until ForgeCAD has a tolerance-controlled rebuild path.

#### `Curve.Reverse<T extends CurveTrimInput>(curve: T): CurveTrimOutput<T>` — Reverse an exact curve without changing its geometry.

`NurbsCurve3D` inputs reverse control points, weights, and knots. Polyline point arrays are cloned and reversed. Sampled `Curve3D` splines are rejected until ForgeCAD has a tolerance-controlled rebuild path.

#### `Curve.closestParameter(curve: CurveClosestParameterInput, point: Vec3, options?: CurveClosestParameterOptions): number` — Find the normalized parameter on an exact curve closest to a world point.

This is the query companion to `Curve.Trim()`: use it to locate where a construction point lands on an existing rail, surface boundary, or edge curve, then trim/sweep from that real geometric station instead of copying the original construction points.

`NurbsCurve3D` inputs are searched by curve parameter with coarse sampling plus local refinement. Polyline point arrays are projected onto their exact line segments and return an arclength-normalized parameter.

```js
const start = Curve.closestParameter(sheet.frontCurve, [-20, -12, 4]);
const end = Curve.closestParameter(sheet.frontCurve, [20, -12, 4]);
const rimRail = Curve.Trim(sheet.frontCurve, start, end);
```

**`CurveClosestParameterOptions`**
- `samples?: number` — Coarse samples before local refinement. Default 96.

#### `Curve.join(curves: CurveJoinInput[], options?: CurveJoinOptions): Vec3[]` — Join touching curve segments into one sampled sweep path.

This is the composite-curve primitive for downstream features that need to follow several real edges as one path: rolled rims, seam beads, trim strips, weld beads, and surface-boundary inlays. ForgeCAD validates that adjacent segment endpoints touch; it will not silently reverse or bridge gaps.

```js
const rimPath = Curve.join([
  Curve.Reverse(Curve.Trim(sheet.frontCurve, 0, u)),
  sheet.leftCurve,
  Curve.Trim(sheet.rearCurve, 0, u),
]);
const rim = sweep(ellipse(0.8, 0.35), rimPath);
```

**`CurveJoinOptions`**
- `samples?: number` — Points sampled per exact curve segment. Default 32.
- `tolerance?: number` — Maximum allowed gap between adjacent segment endpoints. Default 1e-6.

#### `Curve.placeOnXY(path: CurvePath2D, z?: number, options?: CurvePathPlacementOptions): Vec3[]` — Place a 2D path onto the XY plane at world Z.

The returned 3D point array can feed `Surface.Net`, `Curve.Fit`, `sweep`, `Curve.Trim`, and any other curve consumer that accepts points.

```js
const rail = Curve.placeOnXY(path().moveTo(0, 0).bezierTo(30, 8, 60, -4, 90, 0), 12);
const smoothRail = Curve.Fit(rail);
```

**`CurvePathPlacementOptions`**
- `samples?: number` — Optional sample count when [`path`](/docs/sketch#path) is a path-like object.

#### `Curve.placeOnXZ(path: CurvePath2D, y?: number, options?: CurvePathPlacementOptions): Vec3[]` — Place a 2D path onto the XZ plane at world Y.

The path's first coordinate becomes X and the second becomes Z.

#### `Curve.placeOnYZ(path: CurvePath2D, x?: number, options?: CurvePathPlacementOptions): Vec3[]` — Place a 2D path onto the YZ plane at world X.

The path's first coordinate becomes Y and the second becomes Z. This is the direct "sketch cross-sections on offset planes" primitive for surface nets.

#### `Curve.placeOnPlane(path: CurvePath2D, options: CurvePlanePlacementOptions): Vec3[]` — Place a 2D path onto an arbitrary world plane.

`origin` is the 2D sketch origin in world space. `xAxis` and `yAxis` are perpendicular world directions for the local sketch axes.

**`CurvePlanePlacementOptions`** extends CurvePathPlacementOptions
- `origin: Vec3` — World-space origin of the 2D sketch plane.
- `xAxis: Vec3` — World-space direction for the sketch X axis.
- `yAxis: Vec3` — World-space direction for the sketch Y axis.

#### `Curve.Route: typeof Route3D` — Build analytic 3D line/arc routes for sweeps.

`Curve.Route.fromPolyline()` is the canonical route API. It returns a `Route3D` value object, preserving exact route segments, named port frames, and the lowerable `route3d` sweep compile plan.

```js
const route = Curve.Route.fromPolyline(
  [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 50], [40, 0, 50]],
  { cornerRadius: 12, startPort: 'inlet', endPort: 'outlet' },
);
const tube = sweep(circle2d(4), route);
```

#### `Curve.Helix: { ... }` — Build helical paths and swept coils.

`Curve.Helix` is the canonical namespace for helical paths and coils. Explicit constructors keep the pitch/height/turn relationship readable, while `Curve.Helix.path` remains for compatibility with "any two of three" inputs.

```js
const guide = Curve.Helix.withPitchAndTurns({ radius: 20, pitch: 6, turns: 4 });
const coil = Curve.Helix.coil({ radius: 20, pitch: 6, turns: 4, wireRadius: 1 });
```

**`HelixOptions`**

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `radius` | `number` | Radius from the central Z axis to the helix centerline. |
| `pitch?` | `number` | Axial distance per full turn. Provide any two of `pitch`, `turns`, and `height`. |
| `turns?` | `number` | Number of full rotations around the axis. Provide any two of `pitch`, `turns`, and `height`. |
| `height?` | `number` | Total height along +Z. Provide any two of `pitch`, `turns`, and `height`. |
| `startAngle?` | `number` | Start angle in degrees. Default 0 starts on +X. |
| `clockwise?` | `boolean` | Reverse winding direction when viewed from +Z. |
| `samplesPerTurn?` | `number` | Point samples per turn for the metadata path. Default 32. |

**`CurveHelixPath`** extends Curve3D: `radius: number`, `pitch: number`, `turns: number`, `height: number`, `startAngle: number`, `clockwise: boolean`, `ports: Record<string, HelixPortFrame>`

`HelixPitchAndTurnsOptions`: `{ pitch: number, turns: number }`

`HelixHeightAndTurnsOptions`: `{ height: number, turns: number }`

`HelixHeightAndPitchOptions`: `{ height: number, pitch: number }`

#### `Loft.station(profile: Sketch, position: number): LoftStation` — Create a loft station from a 2D profile and an axis position.

`LoftStation`: `{ profile: Sketch, position: number }`

#### `Loft.field(profiles: Sketch[], heights: number[], options?: FieldLoftOptions): Shape` — Loft by interpolating signed-distance fields instead of matching vertices.

Use this path when profiles change character, such as round shafts blending into flat, cruciform, or lobed tips. It is Manifold-only, mesh-based, and slower than stitched lofting, but it avoids profile-point correspondence artifacts because it blends profile fields instead of boundary vertices.

**`LoftOptions`**
- `edgeLength?: number` — Marching-grid edge length for level-set meshing. Smaller = finer.
- `boundsPadding?: number` — Optional extra bounds padding.

**`FieldLoftOptions`** extends LoftOptions
- `simplify?: boolean | "safe"` — Simplification control after field extraction. Default is topology-safe simplification.
- `maxTriangles?: number` — Hard post-extraction triangle budget. Must be a positive integer. If safe simplification cannot reach it, the build fails.

#### `Loft.leftRail(path: LoftGuideRailPath): LoftGuideRail` — Create a guide rail that constrains the section-local negative-X side.

`LoftGuideRail`: `{ side: LoftGuideRailSide, path: LoftGuideRailPath }`

#### `Loft.rightRail(path: LoftGuideRailPath): LoftGuideRail` — Create a guide rail that constrains the section-local positive-X side.

#### `Loft.frontRail(path: LoftGuideRailPath): LoftGuideRail` — Create a guide rail that constrains the section-local positive-Y side.

#### `Loft.backRail(path: LoftGuideRailPath): LoftGuideRail` — Create a guide rail that constrains the section-local negative-Y side.

#### `Loft.centerRail(path: LoftGuideRailPath): LoftGuideRail` — Create a guide rail that moves section centers along the loft.

#### `Loft.pathOnXz(path: LoftPath2D, y?: number): Vec3[]` — Place a 2D guide path onto the XZ plane.

The path's first coordinate becomes X and its second coordinate becomes Z. Use this for left/right silhouette rails authored with [`path()`](/docs/sketch#path) or [`constrainedSketch()`](/docs/sketch#constrainedsketch).

#### `Loft.pathOnYz(path: LoftPath2D, x?: number): Vec3[]` — Place a 2D guide path onto the YZ plane.

The path's first coordinate becomes Y and its second coordinate becomes Z. Use this for front/back crown rails authored with [`path()`](/docs/sketch#path) or [`constrainedSketch()`](/docs/sketch#constrainedsketch).

#### `Loft.pathOnXy(path: LoftPath2D, z?: number): Vec3[]` — Place a 2D guide path onto the XY plane.

The path's first coordinate becomes X and its second coordinate becomes Y. Use this when lofting along X or Y and a rail lives in a horizontal sketch plane.

#### `Loft.withGuideRails(stations: LoftStation[], rails: LoftGuideRail[], options?: LoftWithGuideRailsOptions): Shape` — Loft through profile stations while forcing generated sections to follow guide rails.

Stations define the cross-section family. Guide rails define the side or center paths the loft must pass through. With opposite side rails, the section is scaled to touch both rails. With one side rail, the section keeps its interpolated size unless a center rail is also present.

**`LoftWithGuideRailsOptions`** extends LoftOptions
- `axis?: LoftAxis` — Primary station axis. Default Z.
- `samples?: number` — Number of generated loft stations including ends. Default scales with station count.
- `railSamples?: number` — Number of points sampled from curve-backed rails before axis interpolation. Default 64.

#### `spline2d(points: Vec2[], options?: Spline2DOptions): Sketch` — Build a smooth Catmull-Rom spline sketch from 2D control points.

A closed spline (default) returns a filled profile. An open spline requires a strokeWidth option to produce a solid sketch. Use tension (0..1, default 0.5) to control curve tightness.

**`Spline2DOptions`**

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `closed?` | `boolean` | Closed loop (default true). |
| `tension?` | `number` | Catmull-Rom tension in [0, 1]. 0 = very round, 1 = linear-ish. Default 0.5. |
| `samplesPerSegment?` | `number` | Samples per segment (minimum 3). Default 16. |
| `strokeWidth?` | `number` | For open splines, provide stroke width to return a solid Sketch. If omitted for open splines, an error is thrown. |
| `join?` | `"Round" \| "Square"` | Stroke join for open splines. Default 'Round'. |

#### `loft(profiles: Sketch[], heights: (number | EndCondition)[], options?: LoftOptions): Shape` — Loft between multiple sketches along Z stations.

Profiles can differ in topology and vertex count: interpolation is done on signed-distance fields and meshed with level-set extraction. Heights must be strictly increasing. Compatible loft stacks can also stay on the maintained export-backend path.

The surface is smooth through 3+ stations (C1 spanwise interpolation, like CAD lofts), so it can bow slightly past the straight ruling between stations; sections are matched exactly at their stations. Two-station lofts are ruled. `edgeLength` caps the sample spacing in curved or twisted regions (quality presets scale it); straight regions keep input density.

Performance note: loft is significantly heavier than primitive/extrude/revolve. If the part is axis-symmetric (bottles, vases, knobs), prefer revolve().

`EndCondition` — defined in [sketch](/docs/sketch).

#### `sweep(profile: Sketch, path: SweepPathInput, options?: SweepOptions): Shape`

**`SweepOptions`**

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `samples?` | `number` | Number of samples when path is a Curve3D. Default 48. |
| `edgeLength?` | `number` | Marching-grid edge length for level-set meshing. Smaller = finer. |
| `boundsPadding?` | `number` | Optional extra bounds padding. |
| `up?` | `Vec3` | Preferred "up" vector for local profile frame. Auto fallback is used near parallel segments. |

#### `variableSweep(spine: SweepPathInput, sections: VariableSweepSection[], options?: VariableSweepOptions): Shape` — Sweep a variable cross-section along a 3D spine curve.

Unlike sweep(), which uses a single constant profile, variableSweep() interpolates between multiple profiles at different stations along the spine. This enables organic shapes like tapering tubes, bone-like structures, and sculptural forms.

Each section specifies a t parameter (0 = start, 1 = end of spine) and a 2D profile sketch. The SDF-based level-set mesher smoothly blends between profiles at intermediate positions.

Performance note: like sweep(), this uses level-set meshing internally.

**`VariableSweepSection`**
- `t: number` — Parameter along the spine (0 = start, 1 = end).
- `profile: Sketch` — Cross-section profile at this station.

**`VariableSweepOptions`**

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `samples?` | `number` | Number of samples when spine is a Curve3D. Default 48. |
| `edgeLength?` | `number` | Marching-grid edge length for level-set meshing. Smaller = finer. |
| `boundsPadding?` | `number` | Optional extra bounds padding. |
| `up?` | `Vec3` | Preferred "up" vector for local profile frame. Auto fallback is used near parallel segments. |

### Surface Members

#### `surfaceBand<C extends SurfaceCoordinate>(path: SurfacePath<C> | SurfacePathBuilder<C>, width: WidthProfile, cap?: SurfaceBandCap): SurfaceBand<C>`

#### `SurfaceBody(name: string): SurfaceBodyBuilder` — Start a surface-member body builder for straps, inlays, guards, braces, cuffs, and similar physical members that live on a carrier surface.

```js
const carrier = Carrier.cylinder('guard-envelope').diameter(84).height(36).clearance(2);
const guard = SurfaceBody('simple-guard')
  .carrier(carrier)
  .member('left-strut')
  .band()
  .path(carrier.path().from({ angle: -132, z: 6 }).to({ angle: -58, z: 18 }))
  .section({ width: 5.5, thickness: 2.8, edgeRadius: 0.6 })
  .member('right-strut')
  .mirrorOf('left-strut')
  .member('front-hoop')
  .band()
  .path(carrier.path().around({ z: 18, fromAngle: -58, toAngle: 58 }))
  .section({ width: 6.2, thickness: 3, edgeRadius: 0.7 })
  .join('left-strut', 'front-hoop').blend({ radius: 3.2 })
  .join('right-strut', 'front-hoop').blend({ radius: 3.2 })
  .build();
```

|----------|------|-------------|
| `points` | `Vec3[]` | — |
| `closed` | `boolean` | — |
| `tension` | `number` | — |

**Methods:**

#### `sampleBySegment(samplesPerSegment?: number): Vec3[]` — Sample the curve with a fixed number of points per segment.

#### `sample(count?: number): Vec3[]` — Sample the curve to an approximate total point count.

### `Route3D`

Metadata-bearing analytic 3D route made from line and arc segments.

Use `Curve.Route.fromPolyline()` when you know the virtual design skeleton points and bend radius. ForgeCAD computes tangent trim points, bend arcs, total length, and named start/end port frames. Pass the route directly to `sweep()`.

```js
const route = Curve.Route.fromPolyline(
  [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 80], [60, 0, 80]],
  { cornerRadius: 24, startPort: "inlet", endPort: "outlet" },
);
const pipe = sweep(difference2d(circle2d(8), circle2d(6)), route);
const outlet = route.port("outlet");
```

| `startPort?` | `string` | Name for the start port. Default "start". |
| `endPort?` | `string` | Name for the end port. Default "end". |
| `up?` | `Vec3` | Preferred up vector for deterministic port frames. Default [0, 0, 1]. |

#### `get length(): number` — Total centerline length, including line and bend arc segments.

#### `get segments(): Route3DSegment[]` — Exact line and arc segments that make up this route.

#### `get ports(): Record<string, RoutePortFrame>` — Named port frames, keyed by port name.

#### `toPolyline(options?: number | Route3DToPolylineOptions): Route3DVec3[]` — Sample this analytic route as a polyline for inspection or backend lowering.

**`Route3DToPolylineOptions`**
- `samples?: number` — Approximate target point count for the full route.
- `maxAngleDeg?: number` — Maximum angular spacing on arc segments. Default 6 degrees.

### `NurbsCurve3D`

**Properties:**

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|

| `weights` | `number[]` | — |
| `knots` | `number[]` | — |
| `degree` | `number` | — |
| `closed` | `boolean` | — |

**Methods:**

#### `tangentAt(t: number): Vec3` — Evaluate the unit tangent vector at parameter t ∈ [0, 1].

#### `sample(count?: number): Vec3[]` — Sample the curve uniformly at `count` points.

#### `sampleAdaptive(minCount?: number, maxCount?: number): Vec3[]` — Sample with adaptive density — more points in high-curvature regions.

### `NurbsSurface`

**Properties:**

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `controlGrid` | `Vec3[][]` | — |
| `weightsGrid` | `number[][]` | — |
| `knotsU` | `number[]` | — |
| `knotsV` | `number[]` | — |
| `degreeU` | `number` | — |
| `degreeV` | `number` | — |
| `nU` | `number` | — |
| `nV` | `number` | — |
| `domain` | `SurfaceDomainCompilePlan` | — |

**Methods:**

#### `pointAt(u: number, v: number): Vec3` — Evaluate the surface at parameters (u, v) ∈ [0, 1]². Uses tensor product evaluation: evaluate basis functions in U and V independently.

#### `normalAt(u: number, v: number): Vec3` — Evaluate the surface unit normal at (u, v) from analytic first derivatives.

Uses Algorithm A2.3 basis-function derivatives with the rational quotient rule, so the normal is exact (no finite-difference epsilon, no error near the boundary). Constant chain-rule factors from the parameter remap scale Su and Sv positively and cancel under normalization, so they are omitted.

#### `derivativesAt(u: number, v: number): { S: Vec3; Su: Vec3; Sv: Vec3; }` — Analytic first partial derivatives S_u, S_v (rational quotient rule).

#### `tessellate(resU?: number, resV?: number): { positions: Vec3[]; normals: Vec3[]; indices: number[]; }` — Tessellate the surface into a triangle mesh. Returns positions, normals, and triangle indices.

### `Sheet`

A parametric open surface value (control grid + knots + analytic differential geometry).

**Properties:**

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `surface` | `BSplineSurface` | — |

**Methods:**

#### `get frontEdge(): SheetEdge` — Edge naming follows parameter direction (documented): front=v0, rear=v1, left=u0, right=u1.

#### `get frontCurve(): NurbsCurve3D` — Exact curve along the front boundary (`v = 0`).

#### `get rearCurve(): NurbsCurve3D` — Exact curve along the rear boundary (`v = 1`).

#### `get leftCurve(): NurbsCurve3D` — Exact curve along the left boundary (`u = 0`).

#### `get rightCurve(): NurbsCurve3D` — Exact curve along the right boundary (`u = 1`).

#### `curveAlong(edge: SheetEdge): NurbsCurve3D` — Extract an exact NURBS iso-curve from one of this sheet's boundary edges.

Use this when a downstream feature should be driven by the actual sheet boundary, such as a swept rim, seam bead, trim strip, or adjacent blend.

`SheetEdge` — defined in [core](/docs/core).

#### `curveAlongU(vInput: number): NurbsCurve3D` — Extract an exact NURBS iso-curve in the sheet U direction at fixed `v`.

Use this for centerline rails, ribs, beads, and trim features that live on the interior of a freeform sheet instead of on a boundary edge.

#### `curveAlongV(uInput: number): NurbsCurve3D` — Extract an exact NURBS iso-curve in the sheet V direction at fixed `u`.

Use this for cross-surface rails, seam lines, straps, and inspection paths that should be driven by the sheet parameterization rather than global axes.

#### `pathAlong(edge: SheetEdge, options?: SheetPathAlongOptions): Vec3[]` — Sample a world-space path along a sheet boundary edge.

Use this when a downstream feature should follow the real surface edge but does not need to stay an exact NURBS curve, for example a lip, gasket bead, trim strip, weld seam, or inlay lifted off the surface by `normalOffset`.

`SheetPathAlongOptions` — defined in [core](/docs/core).

#### `pathAlongBoundary(spans: SheetBoundaryPathSpan[], options?: SheetBoundaryPathOptions): Vec3[]` — Sample one connected path across ordered sheet boundary edge spans.

This is the composite-boundary primitive for rolled rims, weld beads, gaskets, trim strips, and inlays that follow several sheet edges as one continuous rail. Span `start` / `end` values may be normalized parameters or world points; world points are resolved to the closest point on that edge so callers do not have to manually invoke `Curve.closestParameter()`.

`SheetBoundaryPathSpan` — defined in [core](/docs/core).

`SheetBoundaryPathOptions` — defined in [core](/docs/core).

#### `pathAlongU(vInput: number, options?: SheetPathAlongOptions): Vec3[]` — Sample a world-space path in the sheet U direction at fixed `v`.

Unlike `curveAlongU()`, this can lift points along the analytic normal with `normalOffset`, which is the common path for swept ribs, inlays, and raised details on a freeform carrier surface.

#### `pathAlongV(uInput: number, options?: SheetPathAlongOptions): Vec3[]` — Sample a world-space path in the sheet V direction at fixed `u`.

Use this for lifted cross-surface features where a sampled path is more useful than an exact iso-curve, for example straps, grooves, or probes.

#### `frameAt(uInput: number, vInput: number, options?: SheetFrameOptions): SheetFrame` — Build an orthonormal local work frame on the sheet.

This is the "construct tangent plane/frame on a surface" primitive for downstream sketches, profiles, fixtures, inspection probes, and features that must be oriented from the sheet itself rather than global axes.

`SheetFrameOptions` — defined in [core](/docs/core).

#### `framePerpendicularToU(uInput: number, vInput: number, options?: SheetFrameOptions): SheetFrame` — Build a section work frame perpendicular to the sheet's U direction.

This is the "plane normal to path" primitive for ribs, raised handles, bosses, and other details whose cross-sections should be sketched across a carrier surface while marching along the surface U direction. The returned frame can be passed directly to `Shape.sliceOnFrame()`.

#### `framePerpendicularToV(uInput: number, vInput: number, options?: SheetFrameOptions): SheetFrame` — Build a section work frame perpendicular to the sheet's V direction.

Use this when the guide path runs in the surface V direction and the sketch profile should span the U direction while its height follows the surface normal. The returned frame can be passed directly to `Shape.sliceOnFrame()`.

#### `toShape(options?: { resolution?: number; topology?: boolean; }): Shape` — Return this open sheet as a renderable surface Shape.

#### `thicken(wall: number, options?: { resolution?: number; }): Shape` — Offset the sheet along its analytic normals into a watertight solid shell of the given wall thickness. Throws if the wall would self-intersect on a concave region (no silent degenerate solid).

#### `thickenInsideBy(thickness: ThicknessInput, options?: { resolution?: number; }): Shape` — Thicken this sheet inward by a scalar UV thickness field.

Numeric input delegates to `Sheet.thicken()`. `Thickness.*` fields produce a sampled solid because a variable normal offset is not generally an exact NURBS surface.

#### `matchEdge(edge: SheetEdge): MatchEdgeBuilder` — Per-edge continuity match against a neighbor (returns a NEW Sheet).

- `get rearEdge(): SheetEdge`
- `get leftEdge(): SheetEdge`
- `get rightEdge(): SheetEdge`
- `pointAt(u: number, v: number): Vec3`
- `normalAt(u: number, v: number): Vec3`
- `curvatureAt(u: number, v: number): SurfaceCurvature`

### `PathBuilder`

**Line Segments**

#### `moveTo(x: number, y: number): this` — Move the cursor to an absolute position without drawing a segment.

When called after the initial [`path()`](/docs/sketch#path), this establishes the start of the outline. Calling `moveTo` again mid-path starts a new sub-path (hole in `close()`, separate segment for [`stroke()`](/docs/sketch#stroke)).

#### `lineTo(x: number, y: number): this` — Draw a straight line from the current cursor to an absolute position.

#### `lineH(dx: number): this` — Draw a horizontal line segment by `dx` units from the current cursor.

Positive `dx` moves right; negative moves left.

#### `lineV(dy: number): this` — Draw a vertical line segment by `dy` units from the current cursor.

Positive `dy` moves up; negative moves down.

#### `lineAngled(length: number, degrees: number): this` — Draw a line at the given angle and length from the current cursor.

Angle convention: `0°` points right (+X), `90°` points up (+Y).

```ts
// L-bracket with angled return
path().moveTo(0, 0).lineH(50).lineV(-70).lineAngled(20, 235).stroke(4);
```

**Arcs**

#### `arc(cx: number, cy: number, radius: number, startDeg: number, endDeg: number): this` — Draw an arc defined by center, radius, and angle range (no trig needed). If the path has no segments yet, automatically moves to the arc start. Positive sweep (startDeg < endDeg) = CCW, negative = CW.

```js
// Arc centered at (10, 0), radius 50, from -30° to +30°
path().arc(10, 0, 50, -30, 30).stroke(8, 'Round')
```

#### `arcTo(x: number, y: number, radius: number, clockwise?: boolean): this` — Draw a circular arc from the current position to (x, y) with the given radius. `clockwise=true` → arc curves to the right of the start→end direction. `clockwise=false` → arc curves to the left of the start→end direction.

#### `tangentArcTo(x: number, y: number): this` — G1-continuous arc — radius derived from current tangent + endpoint. Throws if endpoint is collinear with current direction.

**Curves**

#### `bezierTo(cp1x: number, cp1y: number, cp2x: number, cp2y: number, x: number, y: number): this` — Cubic bezier from current position to (x, y) via two control points.

**Closing & Output**

#### `close(): Sketch` — Close the path and return a filled [`Sketch`](/docs/sketch#sketch).

The winding of the polygon is automatically corrected to CCW (the expected orientation for ForgeCAD sketches). If the path contains multiple sub-paths (started with subsequent `moveTo` calls), the first sub-path is the outer contour and subsequent sub-paths become holes subtracted from it.

Edge labels (assigned with `.label('name')`) are transferred to the resulting sketch and propagate through `extrude()`, `revolve()`, `loft()`, and `sweep()` into named faces on the resulting [`Shape`](/docs/core#shape).

```ts
const triangle = path().moveTo(0, 0).lineH(50).lineV(30).close();

// With a hole (second sub-path)
const frame = path()
  .moveTo(0, 0).lineH(40).lineV(30).lineH(-40).close(); // outer
  // (hole would be added with another moveTo and line sequence before close)
```

#### `closeLabel(name: string): Sketch` — Label the closing segment and close the path. Shorthand for labeling the implicit line from the last point back to the start, then closing.

#### `stroke(width: number, join?: "Round" | "Square"): Sketch` — Thicken an open polyline (centerline) into a solid filled profile with uniform width.

Expands the path into a closed profile `width` units wide (half-width on each side of the centerline). Use `'Round'` for ribs, wire traces, and organic profiles — it adds semicircular endcaps and rounds joins. Use `'Square'` (default) for sharp miter joins without endcaps.

Not the same as rounding corners of a closed polygon — for mixed sharp-and-rounded outlines, build the polygon first and apply `.filletCorner([x, y], radius)` per corner.

```ts
// Square-join L-bracket
const bracket = path().moveTo(0, 0).lineH(50).lineV(-70).lineAngled(20, 235).stroke(4);

// Round-join rib
const rib = path().moveTo(0, 0).lineH(60).stroke(6, 'Round');

// Equivalent standalone form
const wire = stroke([[0, 0], [50, 0], [50, -70]], 4);
```

and semicircular endcaps.

#### `label(name: string): this` — Label the most recently added segment. Labels are born here and grow into face names when the sketch is extruded, lofted, swept, or revolved.

Labels must be unique within a path. Each segment can have at most one label.

**Other**

#### `getX(): number` — Current cursor X position.

#### `getY(): number` — Current cursor Y position.

#### `lineBy(dx: number, dy: number): this` — Draw a line by a relative `(dx, dy)` displacement from the current cursor.

#### `arcBy(dx: number, dy: number, radius: number, clockwise?: boolean): this` — Draw an arc to a point offset from the current cursor.

#### `bezierBy(dcp1x: number, dcp1y: number, dcp2x: number, dcp2y: number, dx: number, dy: number): this` — Draw a cubic Bezier using control points relative to the current cursor.

#### `arcAround(cx: number, cy: number, sweepDeg: number): this` — Arc around a known center point, sweeping by the given angle. Radius is derived from the distance between the current position and the center. Positive sweep = CCW (math convention), negative = CW.

```js
// Arc 90° CCW around (50, 50)
path().moveTo(70, 50).arcAround(50, 50, 90)
// Arc 45° CW around the origin
path().moveTo(10, 0).arcAround(0, 0, -45)
```

#### `arcAroundRelative(dx: number, dy: number, sweepDeg: number): this` — Arc around a center point given as an offset from the current position. `(dx, dy)` is the vector from the current point to the center. Positive sweep = CCW (math convention), negative = CW.

```js
// Arc 90° CCW around a center 20 units to the right
path().moveTo(50, 50).arcAroundRelative(20, 0, 90)
// Equivalent to: path().moveTo(50, 50).arcAround(70, 50, 90)
```

#### `smoothCapTo(endX: number, endY: number, cornerRadius: number, capRadius: number): this` — Smooth three-arc end cap from the current position to (endX, endY). Inserts: small corner arc → large cap arc → small corner arc, all G1-continuous.

#### `tangentBezierTo(cp2x: number, cp2y: number, x: number, y: number, weight?: number): this` — G1-continuous cubic bezier — first control point is auto-derived from the current tangent direction. `weight` controls how far the auto-placed control point extends along the tangent (default: 1/3 of the chord).

The second control point `(cp2x, cp2y)` must be provided — it controls the arrival curvature. For a fully automatic smooth curve, see `smoothThrough`.

#### `smoothThrough(waypoints: Vec2[], tension?: number): this` — Catmull-Rom spline through a list of waypoints from the current position. The current position is included as the first point. The last waypoint becomes the new cursor position.

#### `nurbsTo(controlPoints: Vec2[], opts?: { weights?: number[]; degree?: number; }): this` — Rational B-spline edge to (x, y) with explicit control points and weights.

The control points define the B-spline shape between the current position and (x, y). The current position is NOT included in `controlPoints` — it is automatically prepended. The endpoint (x, y) is the last control point.

#### `exactArcTo(x: number, y: number, opts?: { radius?: number; clockwise?: boolean; }): this` — Exact circular arc to (x, y) using a rational quadratic NURBS.

Unlike `arcTo()` which tessellates to a polyline, this preserves the exact arc definition. When extruded through the OCCT backend, it produces a true cylindrical face — not a faceted approximation.

#### `fillet(radius: number): this` — Round the last corner (the junction between the previous two segments) with a tangent arc of the given radius.

Must be called after at least two line/arc segments that form a corner. The fillet trims back both segments and inserts a tangent arc.

```js
path().moveTo(0,0).lineTo(10,0).lineTo(10,10).fillet(2).lineTo(0,10).close()
```

#### `chamfer(distance: number): this` — Chamfer the last corner with a straight cut of the given distance.

```js
path().moveTo(0,0).lineTo(10,0).lineTo(10,10).chamfer(2).lineTo(0,10).close()
```

#### `mirror(axis: "x" | "y" | Vec2): this` — Mirror all existing segments across an axis and append the mirrored copy in reverse order, creating a symmetric path. The axis passes through the current cursor position.

'y' mirrors across the local Y-axis (flips X), or `[nx, ny]` for an arbitrary axis direction.

```js
// Build right half, mirror to get full symmetric profile
path().moveTo(0,0).lineTo(10,0).lineTo(10,5).mirror('x').close()
```

#### `toPolyline(): Vec2[]` — Return the open path as a sampled 2D polyline.

This is for construction geometry such as guide rails, measured centerlines, and curve-driven helpers where the authored path should stay open instead of becoming a filled sketch or stroked profile.

```ts
const rail = path()
  .moveTo(24, 0)
  .bezierTo(32, 44, 28, 92, 18, 120)
  .toPolyline();
```

#### `closeOffset(delta: number, join?: "Round" | "Square" | "Miter"): Sketch` — Close the path and return an offset version of the filled Sketch. Positive delta expands outward, negative shrinks inward.

**Methods:**

#### `on(skin: ProductSkin, points: ProductRibbonPathPoint[], options?: ProductRibbonBuildOptions): this` — Follow a ProductSkin with side/u/v path queries or refs.

This is the highest-fidelity mode because every interpolated sample is resolved through ProductSkin.frame(), so the ribbon bends along the selected side as station width/depth changes. All query path points must stay on one side; split side transitions into separate ribbons.

**`ProductRibbonPathPoint`** — Path point for Product.ribbon().on(...): either a side/u/v query or a resolved surface ref.

`ProductSkinRefQuery | ProductSurfaceRef`

#### `fromRefs(points: ProductSurfaceRef[], options?: ProductRibbonBuildOptions): this` — Follow explicit surface refs.

Useful for named refs or paths assembled elsewhere. The builder resolves each ref frame and interpolates between those frames; use on(skin, points) when you need full skin-side sampling between sparse control points.

#### `width(width: number): this` — Set ribbon width in millimeters.

### `ProductSkinCarrier`

**Properties:**

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `skin` | `ProductSkin` | — |
| `name` | `string` | — |
| `kind` | `"productSkin"` | — |

**Methods:**

#### `sideTransition(fromSide: ProductSkinSide, toSide: ProductSkinSide, input?: ProductSkinSideTransitionInput): ProductSkinSideTransition` — Return matching side-local coordinates for an explicit split-member transition.

Each SurfacePath still stays on one ProductSkin side. Use this helper to create one member ending on `from`, another starting on `to`, then join named anchors.

Rules: only adjacent `left`/`top`/`right`/`bottom` sides are supported — for front/rear caps use `Product.panel()`. `v` is normalized 0–1 along the shared boundary (default 0.5); `name` must be non-empty when provided; `offset` lifts both coordinates off the surface. Throws if the returned boundary coordinates are not physically coincident — check side order, `v`, and `offset`.

`ProductSkinSideTransitionInput`: `{ name?: string, v?: number, offset?: number }`

`ProductSkinSideTransition`: `{ name?: string, from: ProductSkinSurfaceCoordinate, to: ProductSkinSurfaceCoordinate }`

`ProductSkinSurfaceCoordinate`: `{ kind?: "productSkin", side?: ProductSkinSide, u?: number, v?: number, offset?: number }`

#### `sideTransitionChain(sides: ProductSkinSide[], input?: ProductSkinSideTransitionInput): ProductSkinSideTransition[]` — Return a sequence of matching side-local coordinates for an explicit multi-side split-member route.

Each adjacent side pair becomes one named transition. Build one member per side segment, add transition anchors at each returned pair, then join the anchors. The same validation as `sideTransition()` applies to every adjacent pair.

#### `sideRoute(input: ProductSkinSideRouteInput): ProductSkinSideRoute` — Return side-local member segments for a generated multi-side split-member route.

The route still compiles as explicit members plus named-anchor joins. This helper only generates the per-side segment endpoints and transition names.

**`ProductSkinSideRouteInput`**: `name?: string`, `sides: ProductSkinSide[]`, `from: ProductSkinSurfaceCoordinate`, `to: ProductSkinSurfaceCoordinate`, `v?: number`, `offset?: number`

`ProductSkinSideRoute`: `{ name?: string, transitions: ProductSkinSideTransition[], segments: ProductSkinSideRouteSegment[] }`

**`ProductSkinSideRouteSegment`**: `name: string`, `side: ProductSkinSide`, `from: ProductSkinSurfaceCoordinate`, `to: ProductSkinSurfaceCoordinate`, `startAnchorName?: string`, `endAnchorName?: string`

#### `holes(): SurfaceBandHoleRegion[]` — Resolve recorded hole regions into member-local across/along loops.

- `widthAt(t: number): number`

### `SurfaceBodyBuilder`

Builder for a named surface-member body. Owns named members — `band()` or `plate()` — and the joins between them. Features (slots, cutouts, lips, cups, ribs) attach to a member's local coordinate system before lowering; this is not a global boolean recipe.

**Properties:**

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | — |

**Methods:**

#### `join(from: string, to: string | string[]): SurfaceJoinBuilder` — Declare a join between named members. Only a limited join set lowers to real geometry: close endpoint pairs, selected named-anchor pairs (`.betweenAnchors()`), and sampled band/plate landing pads. Farther, missing-anchor, or ambiguous joins remain diagnostic-only intent — decompose the design into supported joins instead of expecting a fallback.

#### `autoJoinAtSharedAnchors(): this` — Lower only unambiguous shared-endpoint pairs (exactly two members sharing a point) into junction geometry. Shared points with more than two members produce a warning diagnostic — declare explicit `.join(...)` relationships instead.

#### `build(): Shape | ShapeGroup` — Build and return only the member + junction geometry. Use `buildWithDiagnostics()` for the member graph and diagnostic codes.

- `carrier(carrier: CarrierSurface): this`
- `member(name: string): SurfaceMemberBuilder`

## Constants

### `Curve`

Canonical exact/smooth 3D curve constructors.

`Curve.*` is the public home for reference curves and route centerlines that feed `sweep`, `variableSweep`, route visualization, and future path consumers. Standalone 3D curve constructors have been collapsed into this namespace.

Members (full entries under [Curves & Surfacing](#curves-surfacing)): `Curve.Blend`, `Curve.BlendG2`, `Curve.Bridge`, `Curve.Arc`, `Curve.Line`, `Curve.Nurbs`, `Curve.Fit`, `Curve.ProjectOnSurface`, `Curve.Intersect`, `Curve.Trim`, `Curve.Reverse`, `Curve.closestParameter`, `Curve.join`, `Curve.placeOnXY`, `Curve.placeOnXZ`, `Curve.placeOnYZ`, `Curve.placeOnPlane`, `Curve.Route`, `Curve.Helix`.

### `Surface`

- `Plane(options: SurfacePlaneOptions): Shape` — Create a finite analytic plane sheet that can be trimmed, sewn, thickened, or used as a low-level face.
- `Cylinder(options: SurfaceCylinderOptions): Shape` — Create a finite analytic cylindrical sheet, optionally bounded by start/end angles.
- `Cone(options: SurfaceConeOptions): Shape` — Create a finite analytic conical or frustum sheet, optionally bounded by start/end angles.
- `Sphere(options: SurfaceSphereOptions): Shape` — Create a finite analytic spherical sheet bounded by longitude and latitude ranges.
- `Torus(options: SurfaceTorusOptions): Shape` — Create a finite analytic torus sheet bounded by major and tube angle ranges.
- `Sweep(profile: SurfaceSweepProfileInput, spine: SweepPathInput, options?: SurfaceSweepOptions): Sheet` — Sweep an open 2D profile path along a 3D spine to create an open surface sheet.

  This is the surface-first counterpart to the solid `sweep()` function. Use it for class-A/product workflows where the shape starts as an infinitely thin carrier sheet, then becomes physical material with `.thicken(...)`. The profile's local X axis maps across the sheet, local Y maps along the swept frame's up/normal direction, and the spine direction becomes sheet U.

  ```js
  const sideProfile = Curve.Fit(Curve.placeOnXZ(path().moveTo(0, 0).bezierTo(40, -8, 90, 8, 140, 3)));
  const crossSection = path().moveTo(-20, 2).bezierTo(-8, -4, 8, -4, 20, 2);
  const sheet = Surface.Sweep(crossSection, sideProfile);
  const thinPart = sheet.thicken(1.2);
  ```
- `Loft(input: SurfaceLoftInput): Sheet` — Loft an open surface sheet through ordered profile stations.

  This is the surface-first counterpart to solid lofts: profiles are open 2D section curves, point stations intentionally collapse a smooth tip, and guide curves can pin named connection landmarks such as rims or low points. The result is an open `Sheet`; call `.thicken(...)` to make physical material.

  ```js
  const sheet = Surface.Loft({
    axis: 'X',
    profiles: [
      { at: -40, point: [-40, 0, 0] },
      { at: 0, profile: path().moveTo(-12, 2).bezierTo(-4, -4, 4, -4, 12, 2) },
      { at: 40, profile: path().moveTo(-5, 0).lineTo(5, 0) },
    ],
    connections: [{ name: 'lowPoint', profileParameter: 0.5 }],
  });
  ```
- `Nurbs(controlGrid: Vec3[][], options?: NurbsSurfaceOptions): Shape` — Create an exact NURBS surface from a grid of control points.

  The control grid is indexed as `controlGrid[u][v]` — each row is a curve in the V direction, and columns trace curves in the U direction. With default options this builds a bicubic non-rational B-spline sheet with uniform clamped knots; `NurbsSurfaceOptions` controls degrees, weights, knots, trim loops, tessellation, domain, and an optional `thickness` to return a thin solid instead of an open sheet.

  ```js
  // Simple 4×4 control grid — a gently curved surface
  const grid = [
    [[0,0,0], [10,0,2], [20,0,2], [30,0,0]],
    [[0,10,1], [10,10,5], [20,10,5], [30,10,1]],
    [[0,20,1], [10,20,5], [20,20,5], [30,20,1]],
    [[0,30,0], [10,30,2], [20,30,2], [30,30,0]],
  ];
  const sheet = Surface.Nurbs(grid);
  const panel = Surface.Nurbs(grid, { thickness: 2 });
  ```
- `Ruled(curveA: ExactCurveInput, curveB: ExactCurveInput, options?: SurfaceCommonOptions): Shape`
- `Patch(curves: { bottom: ExactCurveInput; top: ExactCurveInput; left: ExactCurveInput; right: ExactCurveInput; }, options?: SurfacePatchOptions): Shape` — Create a smooth open surface sheet from 4 boundary curves (Coons patch).

  The four curves form the boundary of a quadrilateral patch and should meet at corners (small gaps are tolerated). Boundaries are exact by default: pass `NurbsCurve3D` values or `Shape.edge()` refs, or set `{ approximate: true }` to accept sampled `Curve3D`/`Vec3[]` boundaries. The result is an open sheet — call `.thicken(t)` for a thin solid.

  ```js
  const sheet = Surface.Patch({ bottom, top, left, right });
  const panel = Surface.Patch({ bottom, top, left, right }).thicken(1.5);
  ```
- `Boundary(input: SurfaceBoundaryInput): Shape`
- `Fill(input: SurfaceFillInput): Shape` — Create an n-sided open surface sheet from 3 or more boundary curves (energy-minimizing constrained fill).

  Boundaries form a closed loop of any size (n >= 3). They are exact by default: pass `NurbsCurve3D` values or `Shape.edge()` refs, or set `{ approximate: true }` to accept sampled `Curve3D`/`Vec3[]` boundaries. Use `match` to make a named boundary G0/G1/G2-tangent to a neighboring face. The result is an open sheet — call `.thicken(t)` for a thin solid.

  Two optional fields pull the fill onto interior features (OCCT backend only; the Truck/SDF backends reject them):

  - `through` — interior constraint curves the surface must pass through (not part of the boundary loop). These are matched positionally (G0) only; G1/G2 on a free interior curve is not honored, so a non-`'G0'` `continuity` throws.
  - `points` — isolated interior points the surface must interpolate.

  ```js
  const skin = Surface.Fill({
    boundaries: [
      { name: 'a', curve: edgeA }, { name: 'b', curve: edgeB },
      { name: 'c', curve: edgeC }, { name: 'd', curve: edgeD }, { name: 'e', curve: edgeE },
    ],
    match: { a: { target: neighbor.edge('top'), continuity: 'G1' } },
    through: [{ curve: interiorSpine }], // pull the fill onto an internal feature line
    points: [[10, 10, 4]],               // pin an interior bump
  });
  ```
- `Sew(shapes: Shape[], options?: { tolerance?: number; }): Shape`
- `Solid(input: Shape | Shape[], options?: SurfaceSolidOptions): Shape` — Sew surface faces or consume an existing sewn shell and make a solid B-rep.
- `Extend(shape: Shape, options: SurfaceExtendOptions): Shape`
- `Trim(shape: Shape, tool: Shape | SurfacePlaneOp): Shape`
- `Split(shape: Shape, tool: Shape | SurfacePlaneOp): [ Shape, Shape ]`
- `Match(shape: Shape, options: { edge: "u0" | "u1" | "v0" | "v1"; target: EdgeRef; continuity?: SurfaceContinuity; }): Shape`
- `Complex(name?: string): SurfaceComplexBuilder` — Start a named surface complex: a quilt of numeric parametric sheets with explicit edge joins, continuity-requested bridge patches, diagnostics, and conversion to either grouped inspection faces, thickened patch solids, or one sewn solid.

  This is the low-level primitive for fully surfaced objects. Build sheets from cages or curve nets, register them as patches, then bridge named edges like `"top.left"` to `"bottom.left"` with G0/G1/G2 intent.

  ```js
  const shell = Surface.Complex('mouse-shell')
    .patch('top', topSheet)
    .patch('bottom', bottomSheet)
    .bridge('left-wall', 'top.left', 'bottom.left', { continuity: 'G1' })
    .bridge('right-wall', 'top.right', 'bottom.right', { continuity: 'G1' })
    .toSewnSolid({ tolerance: 0.25 });
  ```
- `Net(): CurveNet` — Begin a curve-network (Gordon) surface — the class-A keystone. Chain `.lengthwise(...)/.crosswise(...)` (or `.alongRails(a,b).sections(...)`, or `.cage(grid)`), then `.thicken(wall)` to get a solid Shape. Returns a fluent `Sheet` builder with analytic point/normal/curvature queries and named edges.
- `BoundaryNet(): CurveNet` — Begin a **Boundary Surface** — the canonical class-A surfacing primitive (SolidWorks "Boundary Boss/Base", Onshape "Boundary surface", Rhino NetworkSrf). It fills a curve cage exactly like `Net` (same Gordon interior), then adds the two foundational boundary capabilities a real boundary surface has:

  1. **Per-side continuity** — `.matchStartU/.matchEndU/.matchStartV/.matchEndV` enforce G0/G1/G2 across a side, either matching an adjacent sheet's edge (tangent/curvature) or imposing an explicit cross-boundary tangent.
  2. **Closed / periodic form** — `.closedU()/.closedV()` weld a direction's two ends into a tangent-continuous loop, so a closed-rim surface (e.g. a bowl's around-rim seam) is smooth with NO G0 kink.

  Returns the same fluent builder as `Net` (cage/families/degree plus the new boundary methods); finish with `.toSheet()` or `.thicken(wall)`. Verify a matched seam with `Analysis.EdgeMatch`.

  ```js
  // Smooth closed-rim dished bowl: a closed rim + radial sections, welded.
  const bowl = Surface.BoundaryNet()
    .lengthwise(...radialSections)   // rim -> center, one per around-rim station
    .closedV()                       // weld the around-rim seam (no kink)
    .thicken(1.2);
  ```

  ```js
  // Match a fender panel to the hood with curvature (G2) continuity.
  const fender = Surface.BoundaryNet()
    .lengthwise(sill, belt, crown)
    .crosswise(nose, aPillar)
    .matchStartV({ edge: hood.rearEdge, continuity: 2 })
    .toSheet();
  ```

  U-sides then V-sides, so clean continuity is guaranteed along edge interiors, not exactly at the four corners (same limitation as `Sheet.matchEdge`).

### `Blend`

- `Edge(options: BlendEdgeOptions): Shape` — Fillet one or more edges with constant or variable radius.

  Pass `variableRadius` for a tapered or station-law blend — it overrides the constant `radius`. Variable radius requires `--backend occt`.

  Orientation caveat: for a linear `{ start, end }` taper, `start` maps to the matched edge's first vertex (u=0), whose orientation is not guaranteed to match the named edge's start. If the taper runs the wrong way, pass a `stations` law (explicit `at` positions) or swap `start`/`end`.

  ```js
  // Constant radius
  let b = box(40, 20, 10)
  b = Blend.Edge({ edges: [b.edge('top-front')], radius: 3 })
  ```

  ```js
  // Linear taper from 1mm to 5mm along the edge
  b = Blend.Edge({ edges: [b.edge('top-front')], variableRadius: { start: 1, end: 5 } })
  ```

  ```js
  // Station law — bulge in the middle
  b = Blend.Edge({ edges: [b.edge('top-front')], variableRadius: {
    stations: [{ at: 0, radius: 1 }, { at: 0.5, radius: 4 }, { at: 1, radius: 1 }] } })
  ```
- `Surface(options: BlendSurfaceOptions): Shape`
- `Bridge(edgeA: SheetEdge, edgeB: SheetEdge): BridgeBuilder` — Build a transition strip between two `Surface.Net` sheet edges. Chain `.bulge(a, b)` then `.g0()/.g1()/.g2()` for the continuity order. Returns a `Sheet`; verify the seam with `Analysis.EdgeMatch`.
- `Face(options: BlendFaceOptions): Shape` — Fillet every edge SHARED by a pair of faces — a "face fillet". Resolves the shared edges of the two faces and rolls a constant or variable-radius blend along all of them. Requires `--backend occt`.

  ```js
  let body = box(80, 50, 30).faces({ lid: 'top', wall: 'side-left' })
  body = Blend.Face({ faces: [body.face('lid'), body.face('wall')], radius: 4 })
  ```

  ```js
  // Variable radius along the shared edges
  body = Blend.Face({ faces: [body.face('lid'), body.face('wall')],
    variableRadius: { start: 2, end: 6 } })
  ```
- `FullRound(options: BlendFullRoundOptions): Shape` — Full round — roll a blend over a narrow center face so it is consumed and its two neighbouring faces meet tangentially (classic 3-face full round). The radius defaults to half the center-face span. Requires `--backend occt`.

  ```js
  let bar = box(60, 8, 20).faces({ topRail: 'top', left: 'side-left', right: 'side-right' })
  bar = Blend.FullRound({ centerFace: bar.face('topRail') })
  ```

  ```js
  // Explicit neighbours
  bar = Blend.FullRound({ centerFace: bar.face('topRail'),
    sideFaces: [bar.face('left'), bar.face('right')] })
  ```

- `place(detail: Shape | ShapeGroup, ref: ProductRefInput, options?: ProductAttachOptions): Shape | ShapeGroup` — Place a shape or group on a ProductSurfaceRef.
- `landing(name: string, radius?: number, material?: ProductMaterial): Shape` — Small blended landing volume for manual structural bridges and connection proofs.

### `Carrier`

Factory for carrier surfaces — the coordinate-and-frame owners that surface members (`SurfaceBody`) live on.

A carrier owns surface-local coordinates and 3D frames; members and paths are authored in carrier coordinates, never in raw Cartesian math. Cylinder coordinates are `{ angle, z }` with `angle` in degrees — paths handle seam wrapping, so never compute positions with trig. `clearance()`/`offset()` lift geometry off the nominal surface. A ProductSkin carrier path stays on one side (`left`/`right`/`top`/`bottom`); for multi-side detail, split into one member per side and join them at the matching side-local coordinates from `sideTransition()` / `sideTransitionChain()` / `sideRoute()`.

```ts
// Bottle-cage arm: a curved band on a cylinder, authored in degrees + mm
const bottle = Carrier.cylinder('bottle').diameter(74).height(170).clearance(1.5);
const arm = bottle.path()
  .from({ angle: -145, z: 18 })
  .through({ angle: -80, z: 72 })
  .to({ angle: -34, z: 112 });
```

- `cylinder(name: string): CylinderCarrier` — Create an analytic cylinder carrier for bottles, limbs, tubes, guards, and cuffs.
- `plane(name: string): PlaneCarrier` — Create an analytic plane carrier for plates and local flat construction surfaces.
- `productSkin(skin: ProductSkin): ProductSkinCarrier` — Adapt an existing ProductSkin into the general surface-member carrier protocol.

### `SurfaceMembers`

- `Body(name: string): SurfaceBodyBuilder` — Start a surface-member body builder for straps, inlays, guards, braces, cuffs, and similar physical members that live on a carrier surface.

  ```js
  const carrier = Carrier.cylinder('guard-envelope').diameter(84).height(36).clearance(2);
  const guard = SurfaceBody('simple-guard')
    .carrier(carrier)
    .member('left-strut')
    .band()
    .path(carrier.path().from({ angle: -132, z: 6 }).to({ angle: -58, z: 18 }))
    .section({ width: 5.5, thickness: 2.8, edgeRadius: 0.6 })
    .member('right-strut')
    .mirrorOf('left-strut')
    .member('front-hoop')
    .band()
    .path(carrier.path().around({ z: 18, fromAngle: -58, toAngle: 58 }))
    .section({ width: 6.2, thickness: 3, edgeRadius: 0.7 })
    .join('left-strut', 'front-hoop').blend({ radius: 3.2 })
    .join('right-strut', 'front-hoop').blend({ radius: 3.2 })
    .build();
  ```
- `Band: typeof SurfaceBand`
- `band<C extends SurfaceCoordinate>(path: SurfacePath<C> | SurfacePathBuilder<C>, width: WidthProfile, cap?: SurfaceBandCap): SurfaceBand<C>`
- `roundedSlot(input: { length: number; width: number; }): RoundedSlotBuilder` — Create a rounded member-local slot feature for `SurfaceMemberBuilder.slot()`/`.cutout()`.

  Returns a fluent `RoundedSlotBuilder`: chain `.verticalTravel(mm)` to extend the slot for vertical bottle-drop style insertion (travel is summed into the slot length) and `.at({ along, across })` (or `{ z }`) to position it in member-local coordinates.

  ```js
  const arm = body.member('arm', armPath)
    .slot('upper-mount-slot', SurfaceMembers.roundedSlot({ length: 12, width: 5.7 }).verticalTravel(6).at({ z: 82 }));
  ```
- `counterbore(input: { diameter: number; clearanceDiameter: number; depth: number; }): CounterboreBuilder` — Create a cylindrical member-local counterbore feature for `SurfaceMemberBuilder.counterbore()`.

  `diameter` is the counterbore pocket diameter and must be larger than `clearanceDiameter`, the through-hole for the fastener shank. Chain `.at({ along, across })` (or `{ z }`) to position it in member-local coordinates.

  ```js
  const strap = body.member('strap', strapPath)
    .counterbore('head-pocket', SurfaceMembers.counterbore({ diameter: 9.8, clearanceDiameter: 5.7, depth: 3 }).at({ z: 58 }));
  ```
- `ribs(input: { count: number; height: number; }): MemberFeature` — Create a repeated-rib stiffening feature for `SurfaceMemberBuilder.features()`.

  Ribs belong to the surface member and follow its carrier-surface lowering; `count` ribs of the given `height` are distributed along the member.

  ```js
  const grip = body.member('grip', gripPath)
    .features(SurfaceMembers.ribs({ count: 18, height: 0.35 }));
  ```
