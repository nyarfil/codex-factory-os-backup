// The Render studio's lazy boundary.
//
// Inspect is what every load pays for. The photographic rig — its softbox
// environment, its stage and its two settings panels — is only reachable
// through the navbar's Viewing mode menu, so it ships as its own chunk and is
// fetched the first time someone asks for Render (or, cheaply, on hover and on
// idle, so that asking is usually free).
//
// The scene half cannot be a React.lazy component: CadViewer applies the studio
// from effects, not from JSX. It is a module handle instead — `studioScene()`
// answers synchronously with the loaded namespace or `null`, and `null` is a
// legitimate state that the viewer already knows how to present. While it holds,
// `runtime.environmentReady` stays false and framePresentation keeps the canvas
// covered with the destination backdrop, which is the same cover a mode switch
// already shows until lighting has drawn its first frame. A half-configured
// photographic scene is therefore not reachable: either the studio has applied
// or nothing is presented.
//
// The panel half is ordinary React.lazy, wired in RenderSettingsTab.js and
// MaterialsSettingsTab.js. Both halves are requested together, so opening
// Render does not stage two separate waits.
