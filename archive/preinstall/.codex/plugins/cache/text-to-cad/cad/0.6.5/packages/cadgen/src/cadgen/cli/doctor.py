"""``cadgen doctor`` — report the installed cadgen and check a skill's version pin.

The per-verb skill shims used to enforce the requirements pin on every invocation;
the shims are gone (skills are instruction-only over the ``cadgen`` front door), so
this is the ONE documented check a skill teaches instead: run it from the skill
directory (or point it at a requirements.txt) and it says whether the installed
cadgen is the one the skill's docs were written against.

It also proves the CAD kernel loads. ``OCP`` is imported in a fresh interpreter
(never in this one, so the report itself stays stdlib-only and fast to reach),
and a refused load is named for what it is: on Windows 11 that is Smart App
Control blocking the unsigned ``.pyd``, which the bare ``ImportError`` never
says (``cadgen._internal.kernel_load_hint``).

Exit codes: 0 = installed cadgen matches the pin (or nothing claims a pin);
3 = pin mismatch, same code the shims used, since the fix is the same
(``python -m pip install -r requirements.txt``); 4 = the kernel is installed
but cannot be loaded (the report says why when it can tell). A kernel that is
simply not installed is reported, not failed: a no-deps install of the wheel
(what the release workflow smoke-tests) has no OCP and is still a correct
install, and the requirements pin is what puts the kernel there.

stdlib-only on purpose: this must work when the heavy dependency set is broken.
