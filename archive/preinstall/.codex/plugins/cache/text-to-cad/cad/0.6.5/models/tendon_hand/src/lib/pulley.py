"""Turned, dished tendon pulleys. Dimensions in mm; local rotary axis +Z.

The tendon centreline is the circle (pitch_radius, z=0). The exact circular
groove section is rope_radius + 0.05, leaving 0.05 radial seating clearance.
Outer diameter = 2 * (pitch_radius + 0.50), axial envelope = width.
Bore radius is the *finished clearance bore*, not a nominal shaft radius.
The default driven D bore clears a 2 mm D shaft by 0.03 radially, with its
torque flat on native +X at x=0.75. Set keyed=False for a round idler.
