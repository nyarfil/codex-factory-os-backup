/**
 * The browser half of the backend's development auto-reload.
 *
 * A viewer served by an installed wheel never watches its own code, reports
 * `autoReload: false`, and none of this runs: the poll below starts only when
 * the server says it restarts itself, which it says only when cadgen is a
 * source checkout (see `cadgen/viewer/reload.py`).
 *
 * When it IS a checkout, the backend re-executes itself on the SAME port the
 * moment its Python changes and the work in flight is done. That is invisible
 * from here except for two things: `/__cad/server` stops answering for a
 * fraction of a second, and when it answers again its `identityToken` is a new
 * value. Either one means "the server is no longer the process this page
 * loaded against", and the page reloads — which is also what picks up a
 * rebuilt client, since the page re-fetches everything.
 *
 * The decision is a pure function so the whole behaviour is testable without a
 * browser: `nextAutoReloadState` takes the state and one poll result and says
 * what to do and when to ask again.
