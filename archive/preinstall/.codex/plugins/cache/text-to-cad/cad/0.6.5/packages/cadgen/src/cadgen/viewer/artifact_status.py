"""THE artifact-status authority: freshness verdicts from pure file reads.

What this module deliberately does NOT decide is "is a build in flight". The
caller supplies a snapshot (``build_progress.py``: the daemon's job ledger,
matched to the document by declared output path) and this module reads it.

The server answers status without loading the CAD kernel. Missing or damaged
required geometry means not compiled. Complete native geometry means compiled;
SURF derivation and browser pixels have separate lifecycles. Containment errors
still raise before any store read.

The document's byte digest resolves through index/document to one immutable
geometry tree. Its complete required closure must verify. Saved documents never
consult source scripts, model records or source currency.
