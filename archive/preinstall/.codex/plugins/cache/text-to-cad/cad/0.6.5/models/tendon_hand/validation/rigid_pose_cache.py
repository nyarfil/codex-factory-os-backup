"""Exact authored-pose signatures after cancelling shared rigid ancestors.

Frame transforms have a shared left factor through their common ancestor.
It cancels in A^-1 B, including each finger's fixed neutral fan. Therefore only
joint coordinates below that ancestor can change the relative placement.
No computed transform is rounded and no nearby poses are conflated.
