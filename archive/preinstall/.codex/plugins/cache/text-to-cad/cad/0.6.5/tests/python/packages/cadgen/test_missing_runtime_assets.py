"""A missing packaged runtime must say how to get one.

``packages/cadgen/src/cadgen/_runtime`` is built, never committed, so the ordinary state
of a fresh clone is that it does not exist. Every failure downstream of that is opaque --
a Node child dying on a file it cannot open, a headless page 404ing on its own script --
so the two resolvers that reach for it answer with the fix instead, and the fix differs by
where cadgen is running from: a checkout builds, an installation reinstalls.

The assertion is on the ACTIONABLE half of the message, not its wording: what must never
regress is that a developer is told the command and a user is told it is a bad install.
