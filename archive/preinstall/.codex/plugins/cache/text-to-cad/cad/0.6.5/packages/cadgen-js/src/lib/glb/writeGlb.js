/**
 * The one JS GLB writer.
 *
 * Replaces `meshToGlb`, which emitted a single non-indexed f32 primitive at 72 B/triangle --
 * fine for a download, ruinous for a render artifact. This writer is a generic mesh
 * serializer with no format-specific behaviour.
 *
 * **It is PURE and LOCK-FREE.** Writing a render *package* is a different operation with a
 * different precondition -- it must hold the artifact's generation lock -- and lives in
 * `writeRenderPackage`. Conflating them would make every ordinary `export --glb`, which
 * holds no lock and has no run id, throw.
 *
 * ## Presets
 *
 * `preset: "render"` -- indexed, welded, quantized, meshopt-compressed. For artifacts the
 * CAD Viewer loads; the viewer registers the decoder.
 *
 * `preset: "export"` -- indexed and welded, but **unquantized and uncompressed**. Most
 * slicers and stock glTF importers cannot read `EXT_meshopt_compression`, and several read
 * `KHR_mesh_quantization` poorly. A shared writer with shared defaults would silently ship
 * an export nothing can open, so the export preset trades bytes for portability.
 *
 * ## Input
 *
 * ```
 * { primitives: [ { positions: Float32Array,   // non-indexed, 9 floats per triangle
 *                   normals?: Float32Array,    // same length; derived per-face when absent
 *                   color?: "#rrggbb",         // becomes a per-primitive material
 *                   opacity?: number,          // < 1 makes that material BLEND
 *                   material?: {               // the authored PBR FINISH, if any
 *                     roughness?, metalness?,  //   -> pbrMetallicRoughness factors
 *                     clearcoat?,              //   -> KHR_materials_clearcoat
 *                     clearcoatRoughness?,
 *                     opacity? },              //   alpha when no `opacity` is given
 *                   occurrenceId?: string,     // extras.cadOccurrenceId, STEP convention
 *                   node?: string,             // group key: same key -> same node
 *                   indices?: Uint32Array,     // already-indexed input, passed through
 *                   targets?: [ {              // MORPH targets, indexed input only
 *                     positionDeltas,          //   Float32Array, RELATIVE to POSITION
 *                     normalDeltas? } ],        //   same length, RELATIVE to NORMAL
 *                   name?: string } ],
 *   name?: string, units?: string }
 * ```
 *
 * One node per primitive by default, so a caller can drive visibility per group (G-code
 * layer scrubbing) without re-meshing. A caller that needs a node to mean something
 * else -- one glTF node per CAD OCCURRENCE, so an animation channel has something to
 * target -- gives its primitives a shared `node` key and they become the primitives of
 * one mesh instead.
 *
 * ## Animation
 *
 * `options.animations` is `[{ name, times, channels: [{ node, times?, translation?,
 * rotation?, scale? }] }]`, where `node` is a group key from the primitives above and
 * each track is a flat Float32Array of samples (VEC3 / quaternion VEC4). One time
 * accessor is written per distinct `times` array, so a clip's channels share it.
 * `options.nodeTransforms` (a Map keyed by the same group keys) sets each node's own TRS
 * -- what the file shows when nothing is playing it. Both are export-preset only: the
 * render preset spends a node's TRS on dequantizing its one primitive.
 *
 * A channel may instead carry `{ weights: Float32Array, targetCount }`, which drives
 * the node's mesh's MORPH TARGETS: `targetCount` scalars per time, so the output
 * accessor holds `times.length * targetCount` of them. That is a different shape from
 * every TRS track (whose count is `values.length / stride`), which is why it gets its
 * own arm below rather than a fourth row in ANIMATION_PATHS.
