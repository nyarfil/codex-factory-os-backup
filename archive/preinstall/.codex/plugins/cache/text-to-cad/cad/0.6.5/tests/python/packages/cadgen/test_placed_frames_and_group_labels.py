"""One frame, one naming scheme: what `inspect refs` and `inspect measure` report about a
placed occurrence, and what a subassembly answers to.

Two tom-cad FEEDBACK findings, both of which produced a confident wrong answer rather than an
error:

* issue 2 -- an arc's `bounds` and `detail.center` were world-positioned while
  `detail.params.center` stayed in the component's own coordinates. `measure` reads the
  analytic centre for a circular edge, so measuring an arc against a line on the same part
  reported a 37 mm separation along an axis where they meet, and a 501 mm distance.
  ``assembly_lookup._POINT_PARAM_KEYS`` knew the spelling `origin` (plane, cylinder, cone,
  line) and not `center` (circle, ellipse, sphere, torus), so exactly the analytic types that
  spell their point `center` were left behind.
* issue 5 -- `#camera_assembly` did not resolve although `#o1.8` named the same subassembly
  and resolved its leaves, and a kinematics mate fastened to that very label. The label index
  was built from the occurrence rows, which are LEAVES; the group names sit in
  ``SelectorIndex.group_nodes``, which nothing fed to it.

The fixture is built here in a temp dir with its own store. `models/` is a manual-validation
corpus, not a test input.
