"""The video half of a snapshot: the request, the frames on disk, and the encode.

``--animation CLIP --time SECONDS`` freezes one moment of a clip. ``--video``
renders the SPAN instead: the same prepared model, posed once per frame, and the
frames handed to ffmpeg. Everything above the frames is unchanged -- same Render scene,
same display settings, same camera, same size profile -- so a video is a still
that kept going.

Two things live here and nowhere else. The first is the request's shape: a
closed key set (``fps``, ``seconds``, ``start``, ``quality``, ``loop``) whose
values are checked before a browser starts, because the alternative is learning
that ``fps: 0`` is nonsense after three minutes of rendering. The second is
ffmpeg. It is an EXTERNAL BINARY, not a Python dependency -- nothing in the
wheel encodes video -- so it is resolved (``CADGEN_FFMPEG``, else ``PATH``) and
its absence reported BEFORE the first frame is drawn, naming the binary and how
to install it.

The commands are built by :func:`ffmpeg_video_commands` and run by
:func:`encode_video`, deliberately apart: the argv is what a test can hold, and
a quality preset that silently stops reaching the encoder is exactly the kind of
drift a test should catch without a video card.
