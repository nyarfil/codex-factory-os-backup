"""Tests are self-contained: nothing under tests/ reads, builds or imports the
models/ corpus, and nothing depends on the developer's default store.

The corpus is a fixture area for humans and skills, not for the test suite: its
outputs are generated (gitignored, absent in CI), its inputs may be LFS pointers,
and a test that reaches into it either fails on a fresh clone or passes only
because a developer built something earlier. Each test writes the small model it
needs (a `bd.Box` is enough for every contract that is not about geometry), or
reads a tiny fixture committed with the tests.

The runner gives every test file its own fresh store; a test that spawns a build
should still set CADGEN_CACHE_DIR itself so a direct `python -m unittest` never
reads the developer's ~/.cache/cadgen (that is a convention, not something this
guard can tell apart from a subprocess that merely runs Python).
