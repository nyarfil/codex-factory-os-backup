"""Input-keyed memoization of build123d/OCCT kernel operations.

The incremental-generation design (design/incremental-generation.md) keeps the
deterministic full re-execution of model scripts and makes it cheap by caching
kernel operations on their INPUTS: an op call whose (operation, parameters,
input shapes) match a prior call returns the previously built shape instead of
re-running OCCT. Re-execution + op memoization recomputes exactly what a
dependency-graph system would: an edit re-runs only the ops whose inputs
changed, and everything downstream of them.

Scope and placement:

- Patches install at the TOPOLOGY layer (``Shape._bool_op``, ``Mixin3D``
  fillet/chamfer, ``Face``/``Solid``/``Wire`` factory classmethods) — pure
  shape-in/shape-out functions. The ``operations_*`` wrappers (``extrude()``,
  ``fillet()``…) mutate builder context and are deliberately NOT patched; their
  inner topology calls are the memo points.
- The cache lives in this module, which survives the generation runner's
  first-party module eviction (cadgen and site-packages are never evicted), so
  a warm daemon worker keeps its cache across requests.
  Computed results and disk hits share the same least-recently-used RAM limit.
  Evicting a RAM entry neither deletes its disk entry nor changes an owned result.
- Keys hash current input shapes by their BinTools BREP bytes: bytes stripped
  of location, orientation and triangulation, combined with the shape's own
  location matrix and orientation. A native edit can change a TShape without
  changing its pointer, so input digests are recomputed -- see
  ``_tshape_digest``. Fresh
  rebuilds of identical geometry serialize byte-identically (verified in the
  design doc's Phase 0 spike), so keys hit across full re-executions.
- Every consumer — the missing caller, a warm in-memory hit, a disk hit —
  receives the SAME reconstruction: a fresh wrapper read back from the
  canonical bytes, with its Python-level attributes (``topo_parent``,
  ``label``, ``_color``, ``joints``, anytree children, ...) replayed from an
  ATTRIBUTE RECIPE recorded against the call's shape arguments (see
  ``_StoredShape``). build123d derives those attributes from the inputs
  (``_bool_op`` copies ``self``'s onto the result; ``chamfer`` constructs a
  bare one), and downstream code steers on them — ``bd.chamfer(edges, …)``
  targets ``edges[0].topo_parent`` — so a hit that reconstructed a bare
  wrapper while a miss preserved the live one made geometry depend on cache
  state (the juno shin chamfered on a disk hit and not on a cold run).

Sub-shape identity is by CONTENT while the memo is installed. Canonical
reconstruction has a price: every op result is a fresh read-back, so a
sub-shape the op did not touch still comes out with a new TShape, and
build123d's identity is the TShape pointer (``Shape.is_same`` is OCCT
``IsSame``; ``__eq__`` routes through it; ``__hash__`` is the pointer hash).
Model code that holds a sub-shape across an op and re-selects it afterwards --
``edge.is_same(candidate)``, ``edge in shape.edges()``, a ``set`` of edges, a
sequential fillet loop that re-finds each junction edge in the current solid --
silently found nothing (twelve junction edges, plain build123d filleted six,
under the memo one). So ``install()`` also patches ``Shape.is_same``,
``__eq__`` and ``__hash__``: the TShape+location check stays the fast path, and
on a mismatch the two shapes compare by a GEOMETRIC SIGNATURE -- shape type,
sub-shape counts, and the world-space vertex points plus one sample point per
face (or per edge, below faces), rounded to 1e-6 (``_signature``). Not the
BREP bytes the memo keys with: those are a function of how a shape's location
chain is SPLIT between its TShape and its ``Location()``, and neither
``BRepBuilderAPI_Copy`` (input protection) nor a BinTools round trip
(reconstruction) preserves that split for located sub-shapes -- on a 236
sub-shape test part, Copy kept 114 sub-shapes byte-identical and a second
round trip 219 -- so bytes tell one edge apart from itself. World geometry
is what survives every re-expression, and rounding absorbs the ULP noise a
re-composed rotation leaves. Orientation is not in the signature, matching
``IsSame``. Hashing uses a subset of that signature, so sets and dicts agree
with ``==`` without sampling every curve and surface on insertion.
Two coincident, identical sub-shapes (an edge fused onto itself, two faces
sharing one plane and outline) therefore compare equal, where the pointer
check told them apart; that is the semantics a model sees under the memo.
Hashing uses only the signature's type and rounded vertex points. Equal full
signatures necessarily hash equally; curves/surfaces sharing those vertices
are distinguished by full equality when hashes collide.

Kill switch: ``CADGEN_OP_MEMO=0`` (and ``CADGEN_OP_MEMO_DISK=0`` for just the
disk tier). It disables the identity shims too: without the memo every op
returns its live result and pointer identity holds on its own.

Anything unkeyable — an argument type the normalizer does not understand, a
shape that fails to serialize — falls through to the original call, uncached.
Correctness never depends on a cache hit.

    The first-seen digest of a TShape is not reusable: native vertex, curve,
    surface or descendant edits need not replace its pointer. Recompute from
    the actual bytes on every call. Normalizing handle-only properties keeps
    placement/orientation expressions independent of encounter order.

    The geometry-independent properties normalized here are:

    - **Location.** Stripped, and folded back in separately by
      :func:`_location_key`, so moved copies share the content digest.
    - **Orientation.** Forced FORWARD. A reversed shape SHARES its TShape with
      the forward one, so writing ``wrapped`` as it came in baked whichever
      orientation arrived first into the shared digest: hashing the forward
      solid first gave one digest for both, hashing the reversed one first gave
      a different digest for both. Orientation is not lost -- ``_shape_key``
      carries ``wrapped.Orientation()`` as its own key part, which is where a
      distinction that must not alias belongs.
    - **Triangulation and normals.** Written off. The two-argument
      ``BinTools.Write_s`` alias writes triangulation data, so a shape acquired
      a different digest the moment anything meshed it (a bounding box, a
      tessellation, an STL pass) -- and, memoized per TShape, whether that had
      happened yet was the run's history rather than the model's geometry. The
      explicit form matches the canonical bytes :func:`_write_brep` and the
      component store already write.

    - **Free and Checked bookkeeping.** Attaching a shape to a container can
      clear Free, and meshing clears Checked. Neither changes geometry. Copy
      the topology without copying its geometry or mesh, then normalize only
      these flags on that private topology. No caller-owned flag or geometry
      is changed and no live shape is retained by key construction.

    """A cached op result: class path + canonical BREP bytes + attribute recipe.

    Cache correctness rests on CANONICAL RECONSTRUCTION. Cached shapes cannot
    be handed out live: downstream consumers mutate them (booleans and lofts
    bump input tolerances; meshing and bounding_box attach triangulation), so
    a live master is polluted by its own first use, and every isolation
    mechanism that preserves the live shape loses byte fidelity
    (BRepBuilderAPI_Copy re-serializes differently; BinTools write→read→write
    is not byte-stable for ~65% of real shapes).

    Instead, a cacheable result is serialized ONCE at op time (its canonical
    bytes), and EVERY consumer — the missing caller included — receives a
    fresh reconstruction read back from those bytes. All runs, cold or warm,
    therefore flow byte-identical shapes derived deterministically from the
    canonical bytes, which makes package output independent of cache state.
    Reconstructed inputs produce byte-identical downstream op results
    (validated empirically); a shape whose bytes fail to read back is simply
    not cached and the caller gets the original, exactly as un-memoized
    execution would.

    The bytes are only half of a build123d result. The wrapper's Python-level
    attributes are the other half, and they are NOT a function of the bytes:
    ``_bool_op`` copies ``self``'s ``topo_parent``/``label``/``_color``/
    ``joints`` onto its result and builds anytree children for a multi-solid
    compound, while ``chamfer`` returns a bare ``self.__class__(shape)``.
    Downstream code steers on them (``bd.chamfer(edges, …)`` targets
    ``edges[0].topo_parent``; the packager walks ``children``). So the entry
    also carries an ATTRIBUTE RECIPE: every attribute of the live result,
    encoded either as a literal or as a reference INTO THE CALL'S SHAPE
    ARGUMENTS ("the same object as argument 0's ``topo_parent``"), plus one
    recipe per anytree child, keyed to the reconstruction's top-level
    sub-shapes in order. Thawing replays the recipe against the CURRENT call's
    arguments, so a miss, a warm hit and a disk hit hand back wrappers that
    are indistinguishable from one another and from un-memoized execution. A
    result whose attributes cannot be expressed that way (a ``topo_parent``
    reachable from no argument, non-empty joints of unknown origin, nested
    children) is Unkeyable: the op runs uncached, as it always could.

    Relative to memo-OFF execution, canonicalization may change the exact
    bytes of some leaf components (geometrically identical). That is an
    accepted, versioned change: content addressing absorbs it as a one-time
    re-key, per the no-backwards-compatibility policy.

    (booleans bump tool tolerances, ``hollow``/``extrude``/``make_loft`` fix up
    what they consume). A model that feeds a solid to a boolean as a tool and
    ALSO emits that solid as its own part — the juno cores, cut out of their
    shells — therefore serialized different component bytes on a cold run than
    on a warm one, and the tree hash changed with the cache state.

    - Booleans: the operands and tools run as exact copies
      (``BRepBuilderAPI_Copy``); ``self`` is passed as given because the op
      copies its attributes onto the result and never rewrites its geometry.
      NOT ``SetNonDestructive``: that flag does not merely protect the inputs,
      it changes the RESULT. A ring with two bosses fused on tangentially, then

      validated with.
    - Every other op runs on exact copies (``BRepBuilderAPI_Copy``). An
      instance op's other shape arguments are sub-shapes of ``self`` (the

      copier onto the copy — a standalone copy would orphan them. A shape the
      copier does not know is foreign to ``self`` and is passed as given, so
      the op fails exactly as it would un-memoized. Factory classmethods take
      standalone profiles, copied one by one.

    Uniform rather than probe-based (fillet and chamfer happened not to modify
