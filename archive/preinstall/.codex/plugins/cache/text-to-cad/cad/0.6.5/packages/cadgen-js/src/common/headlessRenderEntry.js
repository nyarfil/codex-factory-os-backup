// — minutes of load per second of video — so a sequence prepares ONCE and then
// answers per-frame capture requests against the model already on the GPU.
//
// The per-frame update is a merged `callbacks.animation` and nothing else:
// cadScene's `settingsSignature` reads materials, edge style and display mode,
// none of which move, so `update()` re-runs the effects pass over the records
// it already built instead of rebuilding them. That seam is the whole reason a
// video is affordable, and `sequencePoseState` is the one place it is used.
//
// The host drives it a frame at a time (`__snapshotRenderSequenceFrame(index)`)
// rather than collecting an array: a 30 s 60 fps render is 1800 PNGs, and the
// driver pipe cannot carry that in one protocol message.

// The schedule itself lives in ./framePlan.js: a GLB export samples the same
// span of the same clip into baked keyframes, and two derivations of "which
// moments" is the pair that drifts by a frame and loops with a stutter. Video
// is the LABEL passed through it, so the errors name the flag the caller used.
