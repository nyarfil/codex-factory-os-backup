"""``materialize(tree)``: a model's geometry from its tree — the contract a parent
composes against.

Rebuilds a build123d ``Compound`` from a tree: canonical component bytes are
cached within a fixed budget, each independent consumer reconstructs fresh
TShapes, and each object is decoded once per descriptor. Components are placed
per the flattened structure, nested
grouping preserved. The result is TAGGED with the tree hash
(``__cadgen_tree__``) so the packager can recognize it intact in a parent's
result and emit a link instead of copying components. The tag is metadata for
the packager, not part of the contract.

The contract a parent may rely on: tree and child order, labels, colors,
placements, exact geometry. Nothing else exists on the returned object — no
sidecar content, no mates, no kinematics.

This module is INTERNAL. Users compose by calling a decorated child; the
wrapper calls this.
