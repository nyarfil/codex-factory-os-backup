"""The shipped palette: one total rule from occurrence name to surface finish.

This is the only place the assembled hand's colour is decided. Read it to know
what colour any of the 3,259 bodies in ``hand_mechanical_candidate_r13.step``
is, and why it is that colour.

Two ideas carry the whole model.

1. A CORD IS COLOURED BY THE JOINT IT DRIVES.

   Each of the 48 cords runs from its own forearm spool, through the guides,
   to exactly one of the 24 joints. Its colour therefore names the motion it
   makes, so a reader can follow one cord from the motor pack to the finger it
   moves without a legend:

       red     flexion / curl        MCP flexion, thumb CMC + MCP flexion,
                                     wrist flexion, and the palm cup
       green   abduction / spread    MCP abduction, thumb CMC + MCP abduction,
                                     wrist abduction
       blue    PIP, the middle joint
       yellow  DIP / IP, the tip joint

   That partitions the cords 16 red / 14 green / 8 blue / 10 yellow, and
   :func:`cord_finish` raises rather than defaulting if a joint ever appears
   that names none of those four motions.

   ANTAGONIST PAIRS SHARE A HUE. The two cords on a joint are one system, so
   they take one colour: the ``_positive`` cord gets the saturated hue and the
   ``_negative`` cord the same hue mixed 45 % toward white, which reads at a
   glance as which half of the pair is pulling and which is paying out.

   Cords are dyed braided fibre, not metal: both sides keep the cord material
   (roughness .57, metalness .03) whatever their hue.

2. EVERYTHING STRUCTURAL IS ONE ALUMINIUM GREY.

   Frames, phalanges, carriers, pulleys, capstans, shafts, bushings, ferrules,
   gearbox internals and all 1,061 fasteners are the single aluminium grey
   ``#a9b7c1`` with the aluminium finish. One grey means the eye stops sorting
   hardware by shade and reads the cords instead.

   Four families are deliberately not folded into it, because each one is a
   different physical material and reads as one:

       dark #17242d   the anodised actuator pack -- motor cases, gearbox
                      housings, the forearm chassis and its jaws, the bonded
                      strain gauges and the resin bond lines, and the
                      compliant backings under the pads and nails
       pad  #ede8da   the silicone fingertip and palm pads
       black #242a2b  the silicone cable grommets at the forearm exits
       liner #d5e7e5  the translucent bowden liner (alpha .28)

The rule is total on purpose. :func:`finish_for` raises ``ValueError`` on an
occurrence kind it has never been told about, so a new part family shows up as
a failed build rather than as a body that quietly ships the default grey.

``FINISHES`` and :func:`lib.finish.finish` remain the authoring-time color
languages used by the procedural factories; ``steel`` still exists there for
the sub-assembly studies, but the assembled hand no longer uses it -- the
palette below folds steel into aluminium.
