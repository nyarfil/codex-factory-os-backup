"""Regenerate the hand's showcase animation module.

The JavaScript written here is generated output, not source: it lands in the
gitignored ``src/hand_mechanical_candidate_r13_animation.js``, the model reads
it back through ``lib.embedded_animation`` and passes it to ``@step(animation=)``,
and it then travels in the STEP metadata the viewer and exporters consume.

The point of this model is that finger motion comes from a cord being spooled in
a forearm, so an animation that moves the phalanges and leaves the cords behind
shows the wrong thing. Everything here follows from that:

1. THE TIMELINE LIVES HERE, not in the module. Poses are sampled on one grid and
   everything else — routes, payout, body frames — is solved on that same grid,
   so the cords cannot drift out of step with the fingers.
2. THE ROUTES ARE SOLVED, not approximated. `lib.hand_routing.full_tendon_routes`
   takes a pose and the capstan rotations and returns all 48 posed centerlines,
   asserting its own joins; at pose zero it reproduces `NEUTRAL_ROUTES` to the
   bit, so it IS the code that owns this geometry. A render module cannot call
   it — it is Python, and re-deriving routing in JavaScript would fork the one
   solver — so the solved poses are baked here and the module interpolates
   between them. Only ~13% of the control numbers move, so a keyframe is small.
3. THE PAYOUT IS THE MECHANISM'S OWN EQUATION. `lib.actuator_payout.solve_rotation`
   solves L_forearm(q) + L_downstream(pose) = L_total(neutral) per tendon: the
   capstan turns exactly enough to keep the cord's total length constant. That
   angle both re-cuts the forearm wrap and turns the spool.
4. THE ACTUATOR PARTS MOVE BY `lib.actuator_kinematics.actuator_transform`. That
   function is small, fixed, and covered by `check_actuator_kinematics.py`, so
   the module carries a faithful port of it rather than a baked matrix per part
   per keyframe; `ACTUATOR_SAMPLES` pins the port against this Python.

The one thing not solved here is WRIST motion. `full_tendon_routes` needs a
wrist packet measured for the pose, and that transport solve is the expensive
checkpointed job — so the showcase moves fingers and thumb, where the neutral
packet is exact, and does not pretend about the wrist.
