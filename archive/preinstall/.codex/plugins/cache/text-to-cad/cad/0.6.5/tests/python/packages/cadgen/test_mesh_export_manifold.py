"""An exported mesh is manifold: the plate-with-one-hole end of issue #371.

`skills/cad/references/supported-exports.md` promises that a mesh export is
watertight. The tessellator's own guarantee is pinned next to it, in
`packages/cadgen-js/src/lib/surf/tessellateWatertight.test.js`; this test pins
what a USER gets — the bytes of a written STL, read back with nothing but
`struct` — for the ordinary part the issue reported: a rectangular plate with a
single cylindrical through-hole.

A cylindrical cut's rim is where the defect lived. Boundary snapping lands two
of the bore face's vertices on one model point, and a weld that misses them
leaves a zero-area triangle that still carries its edges, so the mesh picks up
edges used by 4, 5 or 7 faces and loses its volume. The miss depended on mesh
density, so a coarse `mesh_tolerance` is exercised alongside the default.
