// A clip, sampled into glTF node animation: the export half of choreography.
//
// The viewer and the video renderer DRIVE a clip — evaluate it every frame and
// push the result through the effects pass. A GLB carries no evaluator, so an
// exported clip has to become data: per-occurrence TRS keyframes on a shared
// time line, baked at the schedule framePlan resolves. Everything here is the
// translation between those two worlds, and its whole job is to make the
// translation HONEST — a clip drives five kinds of effect and glTF nodes carry
// two of them, so the three it cannot carry are refused by name rather than
// dropped into a file that looks finished and moves wrong.
//
// What maps, and how:
//
//   .rotate / .translate  exact. The composed per-occurrence matrix is rigid,
//                         so it decomposes to translation + quaternion with no
//                         residue, and the pivot a rotation was taken about
//                         comes back as the translation half of that pair.
//   .opacity              no standard animated channel exists. Refused unless
//                         the caller drops it, and then baked STATIC at `start`
//                         as a material alpha.
//   .visible              same: refused, or dropped by omitting the occurrence.
//   .deformTube           per-VERTEX motion, not a node transform. The `deform`
//                         mode decides; see sampleClipAnimation.
//
// This module is PURE: no filesystem, no glTF writing. It reads a package
// descriptor for the occurrence table the clip resolves labels against (the
// same table meshData.js composes for the viewer, so `m.get("forearm")` names
// the same occurrence in an export as it does on screen), and returns tracks
// the GLB writer turns into accessors.

/** A sampled clip narrowed to the nodes the export actually wrote.
 *
 * The sampler resolves labels against the package DESCRIPTOR's occurrence table
 * — that is what makes `m.get("forearm")` mean the same thing here as on screen
 * — while the file's nodes are what actually TESSELLATED. An occurrence whose
 * component produced no triangles is in the first and not the second, and a
 * channel targeting a node no primitive declared is a hard throw out of
 * writeGlb: a glTF invariant reported to a user who asked about a clip. Settle
 * it here instead, and name what lost its motion.
 *
 * Pure, and a no-op in the ordinary case: the returned object is the one passed
 * in unless something actually had to go.
