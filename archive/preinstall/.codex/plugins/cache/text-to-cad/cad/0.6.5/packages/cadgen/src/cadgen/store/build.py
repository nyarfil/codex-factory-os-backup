"""Build a model's TREE from its returned geometry.

Walks the compound a model returned. Every leaf becomes a content-addressed
**component** (encoded ``.brep`` plus an intrinsic face-color recipe); every
subtree that is a child model's materialized geometry, found intact, becomes a
**link** to that child's tree. The decision is mechanical (§Tree in STORE.md):

- a materialized child with its original native partner, geometry and
  descendant occurrence metadata → link at its world location; root label
  and color overrides are still intact;
- anything else — geometry the model made, an extracted sub-shape, a modified
  child (``housing() - holes``: a new TShape), a mirrored child (a new TShape)
  → the model's own components. No error path.

Each native component is privately decoded and validated before publication.
Surface extraction is a separate artifact derivation and never delays native
geometry readiness. A component without an admitted native codec explicitly
pins its eager surface; no later producer receives the original live shape.

A model's final result contains its authored source geometry, reconstructed
from canonical BREP bytes, whether it declares STEP or only meshes. A STEP
writer (``build_tree_through_step``) publishes that complete immutable tree
before persistence, then assembles the document from those exact pins.
OCCT's STEP translation is not lossless for every surface, so a separate
document tree comes entirely from that STEP's
read-back, through the same builder a cold import uses. Only the latter belongs
under the document byte digest. Resolved appearance and the occurrence mapping
are returned as private publication data, never inserted into that tree.

    """Write STEP and return ``(result_hash, result_tree, stats, step_hash)``.

    The result preserves authored source geometry, grouping/appearance and child pins.
    ``stats['documentTree']`` names the separate byte-derived document tree;
    ``documentAppearance`` maps its leaf IDs to authored PBR numbers, and
    ``documentOccurrenceMap`` maps all authored flattened leaf/group IDs to
    canonical leaf-ID lists. ``documentNodeMap`` maps those same authored IDs
    to their exact written product nodes, preserving one-child group boundaries.
    These private publication fields are not tree content. The caller owns
    document indexes, annotations and final filenames.

    1. Walk the compound (:func:`_walk_compound`): own occurrences, links,
       grouping — and, for each own component, the returned shape.
    2. Prepare the document exactly as :func:`cadgen.store.materialize.materialize`
       would from the published tree (the in-memory draft flattened, links
       resolved from the store, own components read back from their BREP
       bytes). A bounded all-link result under the internal source publisher
       may capture and validate its private inputs here, then assemble ordinary
       occurrences and groups after the callback. Publish the final source
       result and notify the callback, which may await dependent saves, before
       writing the STEP. Direct callbacks retain complete preparation first.
    3. Re-read the STEP with the scene loader, reusing only a complete verified
       canonical document of the exact emitted bytes unless forced. Map every
       own occurrence to its
       node by id (``o1.2.3`` is the XCAF path, because the document's product
       tree mirrors the flattened grouping). Validate own occurrence placement
       and face-color survival without modifying the published source tree.
    4. Verify complete authored-to-written correspondence. A privately retained
       canonical readback keeps its exact selected component/tree identities;
       a raw parse goes through the canonical cold-import builder.

    Any own occurrence the re-read does not account for — no node at its id, a
    member without a shape, a placement that moved — is a hard error (law 10).
    Source and translated component identities may differ; a saved-file reader
    always resolves the canonical document tree by the file's actual bytes.
