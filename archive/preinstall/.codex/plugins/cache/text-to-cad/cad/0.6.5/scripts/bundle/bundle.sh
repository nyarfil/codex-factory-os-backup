Usage:
  scripts/bundle/bundle.sh [--check] [--clean]

The one bundle entry point: stamps derived version metadata from VERSION, then builds
cadgen's packaged runtime (packages/cadgen/src/cadgen/_runtime) with
scripts/bundle/cadgen-runtime.sh. The runtime is gitignored and ships only inside the
wheel, so this is what produces it -- in a checkout, in CI, and before `python -m build`.

Options:
  --check     Build the runtime and assert every required output exists, and check
              that the derived version metadata matches VERSION rather than writing it.
  --clean     Remove the _runtime tree first, so the build starts from nothing.
  -h, --help  Show this help.
