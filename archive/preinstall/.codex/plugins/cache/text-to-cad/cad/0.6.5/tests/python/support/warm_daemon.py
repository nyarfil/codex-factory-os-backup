"""Route a test's model-run subprocesses through ONE warm daemon private to the module.

The suite runs COLD by default (``CADGEN_DAEMON=0``): measured on CI's 4-core runners,
routing runs through a daemon halves a file whose tests rerun one script but moves the
kernel import into a daemon process rather than removing it, and on Windows a spawn is
dearer than the cold run it replaces -- the suite's wall clock did not improve. This
helper exists so a test can exercise the WARM path deliberately, which is the
production default and where ``test_decorator_arguments_evaluated`` found a bug the
cold suite could not see (a registration served stale declarations after an imported
helper changed).

The daemon is private to the module and dies with it. ``unittest_files.py`` already
gives every test FILE its own store, daemon state directory and endpoint, and retires
whatever bound that endpoint when the module finishes; this helper simply stops
opting out of it, and creates the same private endpoint itself when a file is run
directly (``python -m unittest tests/...``) so a direct run can never reach -- or
retire -- the developer's own daemon.

Workers receive only the forwarded environment (cache dir, PYTHONPATH, ffmpeg, memo):
a per-run override such as ``CADGEN_NODE`` is invisible to a warm worker, so a test
that varies one of those per run must stay cold.
