# Build cadgen's non-Python runtime INTO THE PACKAGE (packages/cadgen/src/cadgen/_runtime).
#
# cadgen executes three things it does not write in Python: Node builders (the DXF mesh
# and the mesh exports are baked by a JS child), a headless browser bundle (the snapshot
# CLI drives it in a page), and the CAD Viewer's built client (`cadgen viewer` serves
# it). cadgen.assets resolves all three inside the distribution, so there is one copy
# and one builder of that copy: this script. scripts/bundle/bundle.sh is the entry point
# that calls it (after stamping derived version metadata); call this directly only when
# debugging one stage.
#
# Stages (default: all of them):
#   --node      esbuilt builders          -> _runtime/node
#   --browser   snapshot browser bundle   -> _runtime/browser
#   --viewer    CAD Viewer client (vite)  -> _runtime/viewer
#
# NOTHING here is committed. The whole _runtime tree is gitignored and built on demand:
# the wheel is the only place these files ship, and a rebundle of the snapshot renderer
# alone was 1.3 MB of churn per commit. So there is no committed copy to diff against,
# and `--check` means "the runtime BUILDS and every required output is there" rather than
# "the committed copy is fresh": it builds into _runtime like a normal run and then
# asserts the files each stage owes. scripts/release/check-wheel-contents.sh is the gate
# that proves the wheel got them.
#
# `--check` skips the viewer stage because it is the expensive one (a vite build of
# apps/viewer, which needs that app's node_modules) and because a checkout serves
# apps/viewer/dist directly -- cadgen.assets prefers it, so nothing in a checkout reads
# _runtime/viewer. `--print-outputs` lists the two directories a bundle always produces.

Usage:
  scripts/bundle/cadgen-runtime.sh [--check] [--clean] [--print-outputs] [stages...]

Builds cadgen's packaged runtime assets into packages/cadgen/src/cadgen/_runtime.
None of it is committed; the wheel is where it ships.

Stages (default: all):
  --node      esbuilt Node builders     -> _runtime/node
  --browser   snapshot browser bundle   -> _runtime/browser
  --viewer    CAD Viewer client (vite)  -> _runtime/viewer

Options:
  --check          Build, then assert every required output exists. Skips the
                   viewer stage (a vite build nothing in a checkout reads).
  --clean          Remove the _runtime tree first, so the build starts from nothing.
  --print-outputs  Print the generated output paths (repo-relative), then exit.
  -h, --help       Show this help.
