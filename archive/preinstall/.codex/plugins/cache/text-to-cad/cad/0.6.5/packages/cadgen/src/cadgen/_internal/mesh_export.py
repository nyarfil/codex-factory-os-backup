"""The ONE mesh-export engine and its freshness ledger.

Every mesh serialization (STL/3MF/GLB) — a `@stl`/`@glb`/`@threemf`
declaration produced by a model-script run, or an ad-hoc `cadgen stl|3mf|glb
build` — funnels through :func:`run_mesh_exporter`, so the front doors cannot
drift: one Node invocation, one tessellation per distinct tolerance pair,
formats serialized from it (design/unified-tessellation.md).

Freshness rides content-keyed records in the store's ``index/mesh`` tier: a
record is keyed by the
WRITTEN file's bytes and names the source documents (by content hash) and the
effective tolerances that produced it — plus, for an animated GLB, the clip
request and embedded animation source that produced the motion, which the document's
own bytes do not cover. Both front doors read and write the
same ledger, so a CLI export satisfies a declaration's gate and vice versa.
Records are best-effort: losing one costs a re-export, never correctness.
