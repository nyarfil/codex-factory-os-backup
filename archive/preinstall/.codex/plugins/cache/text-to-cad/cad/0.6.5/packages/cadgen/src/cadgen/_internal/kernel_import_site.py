"""Who imported the CAD kernel first, for the eager-import hint.

``@step`` wants a model's module body to stay kernel-free so a current build
can be skipped, or handed to the warm daemon, before OCP's ~2.5 s import is
paid. When the kernel IS loaded by the time the decorator runs, the useful
message is not "you imported it" but WHERE: a ``from build123d import ...``
at module top is one cause, and ``from cadgen import build123d as bd`` does
not prevent the other -- a module-level ``bd.Align.CENTER`` default or a
palette constant built from a kernel type resolves an attribute at import
time and triggers the real import through the lazy proxy.

A ``sys.meta_path`` finder that never finds anything: it only notes the first
request for ``build123d`` or ``OCP`` and the innermost frame outside cadgen's
own package -- the lazy proxy is one route in, but any other cadgen-internal
module that happens to import the kernel at its own top level (e.g. a module
under ``cadgen/_internal`` reached transitively from a model's own import) is
just as much cadgen's business, not the model author's; naming that internal
file instead of the causal project import leaves the hint with nothing
actionable to fix. Installed by ``cadgen``'s package ``__init__`` so it is in
place before any model module body runs.

One route the finder can never see is the kernel imported BEFORE cadgen --
exactly what an import sorter writes for a model that reaches for the kernel
directly, since ``import build123d`` sorts above ``from cadgen import step``.
There is no frame left to read by then, so ``install`` parses the file that
was importing cadgen and names the kernel import statement written there.
