# cadgen-js

The shared JavaScript half of cadgen: everything the distribution and its
clients both need to turn cached geometry into pixels, meshes, and motion.
This is SOURCE; the built, stamped copies that ship are produced into
`packages/cadgen/src/cadgen/_runtime/` (gitignored, wheel-only) — one sentence
that resolves the one ambiguity the name carries.

**PURPOSE** — the shared dependencies between cadgen (as it relates to
rendering files) and its clients: the CAD Viewer, the docs app, and any
future client. One package, one copy of each shared primitive.

**MAY DEPEND ON** — three, three-mesh-bvh and meshoptimizer, pinned by the
package manifest and lockfile, and nothing else at runtime. **Never React, never app or
workflow state, never Python coupling.** Framework-agnostic by law,
enforced by the imports-direction policy test.

**DEPENDED ON BY** — `apps/viewer` and `apps/docs` (source, via the
`cadgen-js` specifier and each app's alias), and the bundlers
(`scripts/bundle/`), which build it into cadgen's `_runtime/` (the browser
snapshot renderer and the node builders in `bin/`).

## The laws that live here

- **Viewer three-input law**: a client renders from the file, its optional
  sidecar (`<name>.step.json`), and the cache — never source, never a build.
  Animation source is embedded in that one sidecar; no adjacent JavaScript
  file is discovered or fetched. The
  code in this package must be writable against exactly those inputs.
  An explicitly attached editing session may provide an immutable preview
  tree and resolved kinematics instead; it must not alias that tree to saved
  STEP bytes. Saved schema-9 sidecars require a matching document digest and
  use a closed declaration envelope. Their appearance section supplies named,
  sparse PBR materials plus canonical leaf assignments. Composition carries
  material ids and names into mesh data, owns its overrides, and never mutates
  the stored tree or component tessellation. Session overlays can patch or
  duplicate materials and assignments while app workflow state stays in the app.
- **Resource ownership**: component geometry and edge textures can have more
  than one scene owner; only the LAST release disposes shared GPU/BVH state,
  and a failed construction or disposal leaves ownership charged and retryable
  rather than released twice. Mechanism:
  [docs/resource-ownership.md](docs/resource-ownership.md) §1.
- **Demand boundary**: a render-only load builds no selector topology, and no
  raycast accelerator until a ray reaches a component's bounds. Refinement
  honours that boundary — a component with active topology replaces its
  selectors at the same concrete tessellation before publishing new triangles.
  Mechanism: [docs/resource-ownership.md](docs/resource-ownership.md) §2.
- **Reuse never changes what is exact**: recomposition, instanced draws,
  frustum culling, material pass keys and detail swaps may all reuse previous
  work, but none may change exact geometry, persistent cache identity or
  occurrence identity — and changing viewport detail never changes export
  defaults. Canonical geometry trees carry no surface-producer selection;
  reuse requires the exact SURF binding, tolerance pair and payload version.
  Mechanism: [docs/resource-ownership.md](docs/resource-ownership.md) §3.
- **Worker isolation**: each tessellation worker runs one request at a time;
  excess requests wait on the client. A failed worker request reports an error
  instead of retrying expensive tessellation on the UI thread, and memory
  estimates stay on the client — never in worker messages, never in cache keys.
  Mechanism: [docs/resource-ownership.md](docs/resource-ownership.md) §4.
- **Cache loss is never silent extra work**: a mesh-cache read probes, admits,
  verifies the v4 header and content address, then adopts; a strict read
  reports a typed miss before tessellation starts rather than turning a cheap
  decoded-mesh request into unbudgeted surface tessellation. Mechanism:
  [docs/resource-ownership.md](docs/resource-ownership.md) §5.
- **One scene or the other**: `common/sceneSettings.js` is the public
  scene-policy boundary shared by the Viewer and the snapshot runtime, and
  `resolveSceneSettings()` returns EITHER an Inspect theme or a Render recipe,
  never a blend of the two. The closed Render envelope and the rig it drives:
  [docs/render-pipeline.md](docs/render-pipeline.md).
- **Kinematics is data, choreography is JS, independently**: the FK
  evaluator (`kinematicsRuntime.js`) folds sidecar mate data into
  transforms and is the operation-for-operation twin of the Python
  evaluator (`cadgen/_internal/kinematics_fk.py`) — a viewer slider and an
  exported bake agree to the bit. The animation runtime
  (`animationRuntime.js`) evaluates the `clips` exported by the self-contained
  JavaScript source in `sidecar.animation` (compiled by `renderModule.js`), with the
  `m.get(target)` handle contract (premultiplying calls, reset to rest every
  frame, pure in t). Neither half references the other; they
  meet only in the effect records. Flexible swept bodies use
  [tube deformation](docs/tube-deformation.md), deforming the original STEP
  tessellation through analytic centerlines in that same shared effects pass.
- **Direct GLB animation stays native**: interactive direct-GLB loading retains
  the glTF scene graph and standard translation, rotation, scale, skin, and
  morph-weight tracks for a Three `AnimationMixer`. Static mesh normalization
  remains the fallback for unanimated files. Interactive documents are mutable,
  uncached, and explicitly disposed by their viewer owner; a bounded load-time
  pose sample supplies a stable framing estimate rather than resizing the stage
  during playback.
- **Byte determinism**: the tessellator and mesh serializers here produce
  the shipped export bytes — same geometry in, same bytes out. Deterministic
  algorithm changes advance `TESSELLATION_VERSION` and its Python mirror so
  old cached meshes cannot masquerade as current output. Meshing preserves
  shared trim references and treats Float32 transport precision explicitly,
  including periodic seams and primitive poles/apices.
  **Same bytes in every ENGINE, too**: the tessellator runs in Node for the
  export builders and in the snapshot browser for renders, and both publish
  into the same content-addressed mesh store, so whichever ran first decides
  what a document exports. ECMA-262 specifies `Math.sin`, `Math.cos`,
  `Math.hypot` and friends to no accuracy at all, and the two engines really do
  disagree — measurably, on a few percent of arguments. So nothing that writes
  bytes may call one, on the way into a tessellation or out of a serializer:
  `surf/trig.js` is engine-independent `sin`, `cos`, `acos`, `atan` and `atan2`
  (fdlibm kernels in plain arithmetic), lengths use `Math.sqrt`, which IEEE 754
  requires correctly rounded, and an integer power is a multiplication.
  `surf/trig.test.js` holds the line by scanning the whole import CLOSURE of
  the tessellator and the mesh-export builder, so a new dependency is covered
  the moment it is pulled in — and pins a golden vector, because a unit test
  only ever runs on one engine at a time.
  GLB material RGB decoded from sRGB hex is serialized at Float32 precision,
  so differences in JavaScript exponentiation do not change the output bytes.
  Every 8-bit sRGB channel survives the round trip; authored opacity and PBR
  values keep their precision. `GLB_SERIALIZATION_VERSION` and its Python
  mirror invalidate final GLB exports independently of cached tessellations.
- **Loud failure**: unresolved refs, unknown labels, and unknown presets
  throw with the known set listed; nothing renders a plausible wrong frame.

Contract mirrors that must stay in lockstep (each has a sync test):
`lib/cadRefs.js` ↔ `cadgen/cad_ref_syntax.py`;
`common/kinematicsRuntime.js` ↔ `cadgen/_internal/kinematics_fk.py`;
tessellation v4 keys, headers and mesh-index records ↔ `cadgen/store/meshes.py`.

## Working on cadgen-js

- `npm --prefix packages/cadgen-js test` (node:test; no browser needed, ~6 s).
  Every `*.test.js` under `src/` and `scripts/` runs; the runner oversubscribes
  `--test-concurrency` because a file here spends more of its life starting a
  process and reading fixtures than on the CPU. Keep it that way: a test that
  sleeps on a real clock, asserts a wall-clock ceiling, or asks the tessellator
  for a tolerance finer than the property under test needs makes the suite a
  function of the runner instead of the code. Tessellation fixtures live in
  `src/lib/surf/fixtures/`; no test reads `models/`.
- Anything here that the bundlers consume changes the shipped runtimes:
  run `scripts/bundle/bundle.sh` to rebuild them locally. Nothing to commit —
  `_runtime/` is gitignored, this source IS the reviewable artifact, and CI
  rebuilds it from here before it tests or packages anything.
- The viewer dev server aliases this package's source, and Vite's
  transform cache can outlive HMR — if an edit doesn't show up, restart
  the dev server and delete `apps/viewer/node_modules/.vite`.
