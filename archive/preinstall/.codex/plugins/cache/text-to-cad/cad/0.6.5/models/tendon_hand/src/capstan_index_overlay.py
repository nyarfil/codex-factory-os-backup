"""Notched capstans, as a native overlay over the frozen assembled bodies.

The drum turns +-70 degrees to pay a cord out, and nothing about it says so: it
is a surface of revolution, and the six-turn rope wound on it is a helix, which
is ALSO very nearly invariant under rotation about its own axis. Every faster
part -- the shaft at 4x, the planets at 2x the carrier -- is enclosed inside a
static case. So the one mechanism the whole model exists to show reads as
stationary in every render and every animation.

`lib.capstan.make_capstan` now cuts index marks at one angular position. This
script places 48 occurrences of the notched drum exactly as `lib.assembly` does
and writes them as a standalone document, so `hand_mechanical_candidate_r13`
can bring them in through `native_integration.overlay(..., replace=True)` --
the same mechanism the four existing repair documents use. That path archives
by content hash and computes its own digest, so no frozen certificate is
re-stamped and no body count changes: 48 capstans in, the same 48 out.
