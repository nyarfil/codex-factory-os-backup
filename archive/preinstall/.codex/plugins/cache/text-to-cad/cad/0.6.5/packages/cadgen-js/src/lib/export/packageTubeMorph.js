// A clip's deforming tubes, baked into glTF MORPH TARGETS: the export half of
// tube deformation.
//
// The viewer DRIVES a deformation — every frame it recompiles the posed path and
// re-emits every vertex on it (common/tubeDeformation.js). A GLB carries no
// evaluator, so an exported deformation has to become data: a base mesh, a stack
// of per-vertex position deltas against it, and a weight schedule that blends
// between them. That is what this module produces, and everything here exists to
// keep the blend HONEST.
//
// The load-bearing fact, and it is not the obvious one:
//
//   Morph weights blend the RESULT of two poses. A clip blends its own control
//   numbers and rebuilds the path from them, and the path -> vertex map (arc-
//   length reparameterisation, parallel-transported frames, stretch) is not
//   linear. So a morph target at every solved keyframe of the clip is NOT
//   faithful — it is exact at the keyframes and wrong between them, worst
//   exactly where a tendon turns hardest. On a real tendon hand, targets at the
//   solve's own 4 Hz density leave 23 mm of error mid-interval on 1.5 mm cords,
//   in a file where every still frame taken AT a keyframe looks perfect.
//
// So the target times are not the clip's keyframes and not the export's frames:
// they are fitted, per occurrence, to a stated tolerance in millimetres, measured
// on a grid four times finer than the export's own frame rate. The fit is an
// upper BOUND rather than a sample, which is what makes the tolerance mean
// something — see boundsForFractions.
//
// This module is PURE (no filesystem) and it does not re-derive the deformation:
// it drives the same prepareTubeBake / poseTubeBake the viewer's display path
// calls, so an exported cord and a rendered one cannot disagree.
