"""Building a STEP document's tree must never require Node.

STEP is the core build path: it is what the CAD skill runs for every generated model, and
it is pure OCP/build123d. The DXF package is the one that bakes its
preview in a JS builder, and cadgen resolves Node lazily -- ``cad_node_executable()`` is
called at build time, not import time -- precisely so a STEP-only environment never needs
it.

That property is easy to lose by accident. ``cadgen.step_artifact`` already IMPORTS the
Node bridge transitively (step_artifact -> component_package -> generation ->
drawing_package -> node_runtime), so a static import check would report a dependency that
does not exist in practice, and adding one Node call inside the shared generation path
would break STEP for everyone with no test to catch it.

So this asserts the behaviour instead: point ``CADGEN_NODE`` at a path that is not an
executable, which makes ``cad_node_executable()`` raise ``NodeUnavailable`` the moment
anything tries to resolve Node, and build a STEP package. If the build succeeds, nothing
on the STEP path went looking for Node.

Runs in a subprocess: the build imports OCP, and the env var has to be set for the whole
process rather than patched around one call.
