"""Trees: a model's result as a content-addressed object.

A tree holds the geometry a model made itself (``components``, placed by its
``occurrences``) and ``links`` to its children's trees. Two placements of one
child are two links to one tree. Nothing of a child is copied::

    {
      "kind": "geometry-tree", "schemaVersion": 2,
      "label": "robot", "entryKind": "assembly",
      "components": {"<cid>": {"kind": "native", "codec": "bintools-v4", "brep": "<object>", "faceColors": {}, "contentHash": "…"}},
      "occurrences": [{"id": "o1.1", "name": "housing", "component": "<cid>", "transform": [16 floats]}],
      "links":       [{"id": "o1.2", "name": "arm", "tree": "<object>", "transform": [16 floats]}],
      "assembly": {"root": {"id": "o1", "name": "robot", "nodeType": "assembly", "children": [...]}},
      "bbox": {...}, "stats": {...}
    }

Occurrence and link transforms are WORLD placements within this tree. In the
structure under ``assembly.root`` a link appears as a node with
``nodeType: "link"`` and its ``id``; ``flatten`` expands it into the child's
structure, re-rooting the child's ids under the link's id and composing the
child's world transforms with the link's placement.

``flatten(tree_hash)`` returns the ASSEMBLY.JSON SHAPE (``kind:
"assembly-package"``, a flat component map, flat world-placed occurrences, a
nested ``assembly.root``) with component refs as object hashes. Every reader
that used to open ``assembly.json`` reads this instead; every path it used to
join under a view directory becomes ``object_path(hash)``.

# Metadata readers need an independently owned flattened descriptor but not the
# native bytes that produced it. Re-reading and revalidating every BREP on each
# viewer poll made a many-component document quadratic in practice. Keep only
# compact JSON here: callers still parse a private result, while the cache never
# owns native payloads or mutable descriptor objects.
#
# A hit is admitted only while every required immutable object has the same file
# identity observed on both sides of its verified read. Deletion, in-place
# damage and atomic repair/replacement all change the fingerprint and force the
# ordinary full verification path. The resolved store root is part of the key
# because tests and long-lived embedding processes may switch CADGEN_CACHE_DIR.
#
# A fingerprint only reports damage when a later write could not reproduce it,
# and a filesystem stamps writes from a clock of its own resolution: ~15.6 ms on
# Windows (whose ``st_ctime`` is the CREATION time and never moves for a rewrite
# at all), whole seconds on NFS and two whole seconds on FAT. A same-size
# rewrite inside the tick the
# verified read observed is therefore invisible to every stat field. Such a read
# is never remembered: :func:`_stamp_is_settled` admits an object only once the
# read is far enough past its write that the next write must stamp differently.
