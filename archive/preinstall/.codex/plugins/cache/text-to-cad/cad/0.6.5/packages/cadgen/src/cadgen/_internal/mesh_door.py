"""What ``stl.build`` / ``threemf.build`` / ``glb.build`` all are.

The three public mesh doors differ only in a format string, so their bodies
live here and the namespaces keep exactly the thin, fully-annotated signature
their CLIs are generated from. Anything richer in those modules would be a
second implementation to drift.

The engine is unchanged: :func:`cadgen.step_export_target.export_cad_target`
is the one entry, so a door and a model-script run cannot produce different
bytes (design/format-doors.md).

The doors take DOCUMENTS: the mesh is the document's tree, tessellated. A door
never moves geometry — a posed export is authored geometry or another model.

    ``out`` None writes one sibling file beside the document with this format's
    extension. An explicit ``out`` selects its destination. Neither reads model
    output declarations; the shared ledger gates the write.

    ``animation`` is GLB's alone. It is a parameter of the SHARED body rather
    than of one door because that is where a clip could otherwise be dropped
    without anyone noticing: STL is triangles and 3MF is a build plate, and
    neither has anywhere to put a clip, so both refuse it by name. Only the CLI's
    ``glb build`` grows the flag (the parser is generated from that signature),
    so the other two doors reject ``--animation`` as an unknown option; this
    refusal is what a direct Python call gets.
