"""Verify a reported path contact with a boundary-distance separation proof.

OCCT has classified an endpoint outside a solid's exact bounding box as inside.
For a connected wire, positive distance from every boundary face plus one
outside-box vertex proves that the entire wire lies outside the solid. This
does not ignore small overlaps: a wire entering material meets the boundary.
