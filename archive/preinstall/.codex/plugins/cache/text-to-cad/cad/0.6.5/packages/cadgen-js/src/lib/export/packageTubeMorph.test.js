// Baking a clip's tube deformation into morph targets, tested where a bake can
// be self-consistent and wrong:
//
//   - the ANTI-FORK check. The whole design rests on the exporter driving the
//     viewer's own deformation rather than re-deriving it, so the first test
//     asserts `base + delta` reproduces what applyRecordTubeDeformation puts on
//     screen, vertex for vertex. If that ever fails, the two have forked.
//   - the FIT. Morph weights blend the RESULT of two poses while the clip blends
//     its inputs, so the tolerance is a claim about the motion BETWEEN targets,
//     which is exactly where a per-keyframe bake goes quietly wrong.
