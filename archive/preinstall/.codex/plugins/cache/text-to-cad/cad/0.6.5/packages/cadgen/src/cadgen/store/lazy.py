"""``LazyCompound``: a child model's geometry, promised now and delivered when read.

A parent's body calls a child model and gets one of these back at once. If the
child was stale its build has been submitted to the pool (§9 in STORE.md); if it
was current there is no job at all. Either way the body keeps going — calling
its other children, placing them, labelling them — and only blocks when
something actually needs geometry: the first read of the wrapped OCCT shape.
Ordinary assembly construction reads those shapes after every sibling has been
submitted, so stale children build in parallel. Eligible plain
``Compound(children=[...])`` construction can instead keep exact references
through source publication; see :mod:`cadgen.store._references`.

Deferred without forcing: ``Pos/Rot/Location * child`` and ``.moved()`` compose
a placement; ``.label`` and ``.color`` are recorded and applied on force.
Everything else — ``.faces()``, ``.bounding_box()``, a boolean, ``.solids()``,
``copy.copy``, ``bool(child)`` — reaches the shape and forces. So does
``.children`` and every anytree view over it (``.descendants``, ``.leaves``,
``.is_leaf``, ``.height``, ``.size``): those answer from the node's child
list, which forcing fills in, and a promise that forced only on the shape
answered them with an EMPTY tree — a two-part child read as zero parts, at exit
0 — until something happened to touch geometry first. ``repr()`` is the one
node read that does not force: it says the promise is pending, because a
message (anytree formats a child into its duplicate-child error) must not
start a build. build123d reads
the shape through two names, the ``wrapped`` property and the ``_wrapped``
attribute it is backed by (its empty-shape checks are ``if self._wrapped is
None``), so ``_wrapped`` is the property here: a promise can never be mistaken
for an empty shape and answer with nothing. A build123d path not anticipated
here therefore degrades to "forced early": correct geometry, less overlap, never
wrong output.

Forcing: wait for the job's final source result (if any), then use its exact tree — a current child was
pinned at the CALL (the wrapper read its record then), a stale child's tree is the
one its job produced; the first tree a child resolves to in a build is what every
later call composes (snapshot isolation). Materialize it, apply the placement with
``TopoDS_Shape.Moved`` (which shares the TShape, so the packager still sees the
child intact and writes a link), and tag the result exactly as
:func:`cadgen.store.materialize.materialize` does.

During a model body's exact ``Compound(obj=[...])`` or tuple construction,
waiting on one input can first prepare bounded, already-pinned later inputs.
These fresh private compounds remain unexposed until ordinary ordered force,
which rechecks their exact objects before applying authored metadata/placement.
The permanent constructor hook is inactive outside a build frame; active state
is thread-local and clears at constructor exit. Plain ``Compound(children=...)``
first attempts bounded reference composition with an exact list/tuple of
unparented children and no ``obj`` or ``parent``. If that does not qualify,
its original attachment-triggered force can start preparation; anytree
validation and rollback remain unchanged. Nested constructors, generators,
subclasses, and child reparenting retain ordinary forcing without preparation.

A failed child raises when forced; the error names the child, carries the
call site of the ``child()`` call, and includes the worker's output.

INTERNAL. No author names this type; ``type(arm())`` inside a parent is the only
way anyone sees it.
