"""Written STEP bytes are a function of model content, not heap layout.

OCCT's STEPCAFControl_Writer registers each styled product's presentation
graph (MDGPR + styled items + colours) by iterating an ADDRESS-hashed shape
map, so an assembly with two or more styled products serializes its style
section in heap-address order — byte-different files for identical models,
varying per process and even per call. cadgen's package keys and export
records are content hashes of these bytes, so every wobble orphaned a store
package and dirtied committed fixtures.

``_style_tail_plan`` computes a content-derived order for that tail after
transfer (the same post-transfer canonicalization contract as
``_renumber_nauo_ids``). This test builds the same nested, multi-product,
per-occurrence-colored assembly from scratch repeatedly — fresh allocations
every time, exactly what flips the map order — and demands identical bytes.

The plan is applied in one of two places — to the written FILE (the tail
records alone in the normal path, the whole file when the fast path does not
recognize the file's shape) or to the MODEL via ``ChangeOrder`` (quadratic, the
backstop for a tail whose numbers straddle a digit-width boundary). Those two
must agree BYTE for byte, not merely semantically: the bytes are the store key,
so a formatting difference between them would re-key every package in every
store. ``test_both_appliers_write_identical_bytes`` is what makes deleting
neither path safe.

The same contract, one layer down in the numbers themselves: IEEE-754 has two
zeros, OCCT prints both, and which one a coordinate lands on follows the
operation path that produced the shape rather than the shape. The writer's last
canonicalization normalizes the sign of zero, and the tests at the bottom of
this file cover the pass on raw text and end to end over two operation paths.
