"""``cadgen glb build --animation``: the request, and what it refuses.

A GLB is the one mesh format with somewhere to put a clip, so this is the GLB
door's half of choreography. The other half — the clip itself — is JavaScript in
the document sidecar's ``animation.source``, evaluated by the
Node builder; nothing here runs it.

Two things live here and nowhere else. The first is the request's shape: a
closed key set (``clip``, ``fps``, ``seconds``, ``start``, ``drop``, ``deform``,
``deformTolerance``) whose values are checked before a builder starts, because
the alternative is learning that ``fps: 0`` is nonsense after a tessellation.
The second is what the export's freshness key has to include beyond the
document's bytes: the
choreography is an annotation the STEP does not hash, so an edited animation
must invalidate a ledgered animated GLB (:func:`animation_variant_token`) or the
door would report an old clip current forever.

``--animation`` is deliberately NOT ``snapshot --video``, which shares three of
its key names. A video is pixels: it has a camera, a quality, and an fps that is
a PLAYBACK rate. A GLB carries the animation itself: no camera, no quality, and
fps is the SAMPLING rate of the keyframes baked into the file.

Stdlib only, like the mesh door it serves: nothing here may reach the CAD stack.
