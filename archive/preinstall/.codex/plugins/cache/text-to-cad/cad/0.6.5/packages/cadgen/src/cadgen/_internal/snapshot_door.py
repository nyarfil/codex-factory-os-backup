"""The public ``snapshot`` verbs — MIRRORS, one signature per format shape.

Snapshot used to be the schema's one adapter: a hand-written parser whose
option surface a policy test pinned by declaration. That exception is retired
(user directive, 2026-08-30): every rich option is typed ``str | dict | None``
— CLI-side one string (a saved name, inline JSON, or a path) interpreted by
the loaders the verb already uses; library-side a real dict through the same
parameter — so the signature IS the surface and ``cli_from_function`` derives
the CLI exactly as it does for ``build`` and ``validate``.

Three signature shapes cover the seven doors honestly (the old shared
signature advertised STEP-only options to every door and refused them at
runtime):

- STEP: the full surface — section mode, display, kinematics, animation, focus/hide.
- mesh (stl/3mf/glb) and dxf: view/list renders of untyped geometry.
- robot (urdf/sdf): the mesh shape plus ``joint_values``.

The polymorphic ``cadgen snapshot`` binds the UNION shape (STEP surface +
``joint_values``) over every kind at once: a job packet may mix formats, and
each input is still held to its own format's rules at resolve time.

Import discipline: nothing here may pull in OCP/build123d, or the snapshot
machinery itself, at module scope. A model script imports ``cadgen.step``
before its freshness gate runs, and this module rides along.
