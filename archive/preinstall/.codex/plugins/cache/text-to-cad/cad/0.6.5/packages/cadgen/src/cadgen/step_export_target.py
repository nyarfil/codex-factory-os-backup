"""Export one CAD model to standalone STEP/STL/3MF/GLB files.

Two callers share this module, and they offer different formats:

* The CAD Viewer's "Export model" backend — one format to an arbitrary ``--out``
  destination picked from a native Save dialog, via ``main()``/
  :func:`export_model_to_path`. Offers every :data:`FORMAT_SUFFIX` format, STEP included,
  because "Download STEP" is a Viewer menu item. This is a machine ABI, not a public
  verb: it gets no generated CLI (design/format-doors.md, decision 4).
* The per-format doors — ``cadgen.stl.build`` / ``.threemf`` / ``.glb`` and their
  ``cadgen <format> build`` CLIs — via :func:`export_cad_target`. Mesh formats only
  (:data:`MESH_EXPORT_FORMATS`); a model's ``.step`` file is written by ``step.build``
  or the model script (``python <model>.py``) instead.

Both take a DOCUMENT — an on-disk ``.step``/``.stp``, generated or imported alike —
and nothing else. No model script is accepted, parsed or run here, and no export
rebuilds a model: whether a document is behind the script that wrote it is that
model's record's question, answered by ``cadgen store why`` and never by an export
(README law 1; law 7: scripts are programs, ``python <model>.py`` is their one door).

Mesh formats tessellate from the tree behind the document's BYTES, which already
holds the exact surf geometry the exporter consumes — no generator run, no STEP
load, no extraction. A document the store has no tree for is COMPILED from those
bytes (a job in the build pool), which is also the one cache effect this module
has. One Node invocation serializes every requested format from one tessellation,
so all formats come from identical geometry, and nothing is written beside the
model.

Emits a single final JSON line on stdout: ``{"ok": true, "path": ..., "filename": ...}``
or ``{"ok": false, "error": ...}`` (the Node spawner parses the last stdout JSON line).
