# Render Pipeline

`cadgen-js` exposes a staged render pipeline for shared viewer, docs, and generated
snapshot browser-runtime work:

```js
const source = await loadSource(input, sourceOptions);
const model = buildModel(THREE, source, modelOptions);
const viewport = renderModel(THREE, model, viewportOptions);
const result = await captureModel(viewport, captureOptions);
```

The stages keep ownership narrow:

- `loadSource` owns source and sidecar loading plus file-kind validation.
- `buildModel` owns the CAD object graph, records, selection, clipping,
  materials, topology/display edges, and STEP parameter effects.
- `renderModel` owns renderer, scene, camera, lighting, background, floor,
  framing, resizing, and render loop concerns.
- `captureModel` owns deterministic snapshot outputs without filesystem writes.

The CAD skill's Python snapshot CLI remains responsible for job parsing, path
resolution, Playwright routing, and writing returned outputs to disk.

## Modules

### `common/sceneSettings.js`

```js
import {
  resolveSceneSettings,
  resolveDisplayMaterialSettings
} from "cadgen-js/common/sceneSettings.js";
```

`resolveSceneSettings({ appearance, render, quality, camera, display })` is the
shared Viewer/snapshot policy resolver. It resolves ONE of two scenes — an
Inspect theme or a Render recipe — and never a blend of them.
`resolveDisplayMaterialSettings()` belongs to the display half; see
[Display modes, CAD edges and geometry sharing](#display-modes-cad-edges-and-geometry-sharing).

A missing `render` selects responsive CAD inspection defaults, where the
top-level quality, camera, and display fields apply. That result carries
`theme`, the CAD scene settings — materials, background, floor, environment and
the seven-light inspection rig — plus the `materialOverrides` the workbench's
matte PBR channels imply. Only the Inspect path reads them.

A Render envelope is isolated from those CAD fields and resolves `theme: null`:
Render is built from its recipe alone, so no lighting rig, stage floor or
background gradient is reachable from it. The envelope has this closed sparse
shape:

```js
{
  studio: "light", // or "dark"; omit to follow global appearance
  quality: "final", // or "preview"
  exposure: 0, // EV, -5..5
  lighting: {
    rotation: 0, // degrees around CAD Z, -180..180
    size: 1, // relative softbox size, 0.25..3
    fill: 0.25 // opposing fill ratio, 0..1
  },
  backdrop: {
    color: "#e7e7e5",
    transparent: false,
    ground: true,
    groundPlacement: "origin" // or "lowest"
  },
  camera: {
    preset, projection, position, target, up, direction, zoom,
    orthographicHalfHeight, focalLength
  }
}
```

The normalized Render payload preserves omission. The resolved scene expands
the effective values into the RENDER RECIPE at `resolved.render.configuration`
— `{studio, quality, exposure, lighting, backdrop, camera}`, each with its
effective value — so a UI can display the active studio and defaults without
pinning them into session state. That recipe is the only input
`applyPhotographicStudio()` and `createEnvironmentResource()` take, and
`resolved.camera` is its camera. The studio's one fixed finish is
`PHOTOGRAPHIC_STUDIO_MATERIAL_SETTINGS`, a constant of the rig rather than
anything the recipe can reach. Render
always uses its private `shaded`, authored-color display policy with edges,
guides, clipping, exploded view, selectors, and selection disabled. The Render
camera comes only from `render.camera`; per-output snapshot cameras are applied
later by the capture adapter. Animation remains active because it is authored
model choreography rather than CAD inspection state.

The translucent ground defaults to the authored Z=0 plane, including when
geometry extends below it. `groundPlacement: "lowest"` aligns it to the model
minimum; it moves only the floor, never the model or the lighting.
`backdrop.ground: false` removes the floor.

`orthographicHalfHeight` is the positive pre-zoom vertical half-extent of an
orthographic camera. It may remain in a perspective camera payload so switching
back restores the prior orthographic scale.
`focalLength` is a perspective-camera lens in millimetres from 20 to 200 and
defaults to 50 in Render.

Studio ids are exactly `light` and `dark`. Omitting `studio`
follows the resolver's global appearance while keeping the normalized Render
payload sparse. `resolved.render.configuration.studio` reports the effective id
for UI. Quality is `preview` or `final` and does not select a studio; it maps to
the internal standard or high scene policy respectively. Render defaults to
perspective, `shaded`, authored materials, and final quality. Normal CAD defaults to
orthographic `shaded_edges`, Original part colors, and interactive quality;
it keeps authored albedo and opacity while applying matte workbench PBR
channels, and the snapshot adapter turns normal CAD guides off for deterministic
stills.
Final uses the bounded L3 (finest) mesh rung, a 0.25px viewport target, 4096px
spotlight shadows, a 512px procedural environment, and 2x snapshot capture.
Those values are derived from the quality id and do not expand the public JSON.
Explicit `output.renderScale` remains authoritative for the internal drawing
buffer. PNG and video-frame output keeps the requested pixel dimensions:
supersampled frames are downsampled in full before encoding, with labels drawn
afterward.

The two studios use one physical Render pipeline. A neutral HDR key card and
opposing fill card generate a procedural PMREM for authored PBR reflections;
one aligned, model-scaled SpotLight supplies direct illumination and PCF contact
shadows. Softbox size changes card area and bounded shadow softness while keeping
total card flux stable. Rotation moves the direct light and
`scene.environmentRotation` together around CAD Z. An overhead side key reveals
depth; a rear fill card and dim enclosure keep reflections on dark and polished
surfaces readable. Environment radiance and direct illumination share a
calibrated zero-EV lighting budget. Khronos PBR Neutral tone mapping is fixed;
`toneMappingExposure` is `2 ** exposure`. Light and dark differ only in default
backdrop color.

`applyPhotographicStudio(THREE, runtime, configuration, options)` owns the
synchronous light, ground and renderer state and updates those objects in place.
`disposePhotographicStudio(runtime)` releases only those objects. The caller
separately owns the PMREM returned by
`createEnvironmentResource(renderer, configuration, {size})` — synchronous GPU
work, returned directly rather than as a promise — assigns its
texture to `scene.environment`, and releases it through
`disposeEnvironmentResource()`. `environmentResourceIdentity()` includes
softbox size, fill, and PMREM resolution; it excludes rotation so rotating the
rig is a live scene update rather than an environment rebuild.

The ground uses `PHOTOGRAPHIC_STUDIO_STAGE_RADIUS_MULTIPLIER` for its full
square width. Camera fitting uses the same constant as far-plane padding, which
keeps the finite two-triangle ground outside practical product views without
weakening the model-fitted near plane.

Environment radiance and direct illumination are calibrated together at zero EV
across colored assemblies, gray mechanical models, and authored metal/plastic
finishes.

#### What Render's public contract does NOT have

No global material, no color grading, no arbitrary lights, no floor physics, no
glow controls. Adding one of these is a change to the law in the package
README, not a new option here.

Materials reaching that scene stay authored. STEP package material channels are
inputs to the rig: assigned sparse materials use roughness 0.42, metalness 0.03,
clearcoat 0, clearcoat roughness 0.26, and opacity 1; an absent base color
retains the STEP color, and authored opacity multiplies its source alpha.
Static direct mesh normalization retains only the appearance data the shared
mesh-data contract represents — GLB base or vertex color and opacity, 3MF
color, and no authored color for STL. Animated direct GLB keeps its native
glTF hierarchy instead, so its textures and PBR channels stay attached to the
scene.

Snapshot job validation rejects a Render envelope combined with explicit
top-level `camera`, `display`, `selection`, `jointValues` or `quality` fields —
including null and empty values — before loading any asset. Render supports
only the `view` capture mode; animation, video, kinematics, per-output cameras
and output sizing remain available. An interactive viewer keeps dormant CAD
session state separate rather than treating it as a snapshot request.

Photographic Render creates its WebGL renderer with
`logarithmicDepthBuffer: false`. Three's logarithmic depth shader path does not
produce usable contact shadows. Render callers fit ordinary-depth near/far
planes to current model bounds with `fitCameraDepthToBounds(camera, bounds)`;
normal CAD retains logarithmic depth for broad inspection scales.

### `common/source.js`

```js
import {
  loadSource,
  stepParameterRuntime
} from "cadgen-js/common/source.js";
```

`loadSource(input, options)` returns a normalized render source:

```js
{
  kind,
  meshData,
  selectorRuntime,
  displayEdgeRuntime,
  stepParameterSource,
  resolved,
  url,
  glbUrl,
  cadPath
}
```

Accepted input fields:

- `kind`: `step`, `stp`, `glb`, `stl`, `3mf`, or inferred from a URL.
- `meshData`: already-loaded mesh data. If present, no mesh URL fetch is needed.
- `url`: source URL for non-STEP GLB loading.
- `glbUrl` or `resolved.glbUrl`: STEP/STP hidden GLB sidecar URL.
- `cadPath` or `resolved.inputPath`: CAD path used by STEP selectors.
- A caller that passes a `resolved` packet together with any source URL must also pass
  `resolved.inputPath`. Render asset caches are page-lifetime, so a resolved job has to name the
  source its cache entries belong to; a resolved job without `inputPath` is rejected rather than
  cached under an unidentified source. Callers with no `resolved` packet (the interactive viewer and
  the docs hero renderer) render one source per page and need nothing.
- `selectorRuntime` and `displayEdgeRuntime`: preloaded runtimes when a caller
  already owns sidecar loading.
- `kinematics`: pose values for the model's kinematics — a declared preset name,
  or `{dof: value}`. Same spelling as the `--kinematics` flag, the snapshot job
  key and the sidecar section.
- `stepParameterUrl` or `resolved.stepParameterUrl`: model sidecar
  (`.step.json`) URL, whose `kinematics` section is compiled here.
- `quality.tessellation`: explicit STEP tolerances for normal CAD snapshots.
  Render is isolated from this top-level CAD quality field and derives its
  bounded mesh rung only from `render.quality`.

STEP-only options are rejected for non-STEP sources. The old shared `params`
field is rejected, and so is the retired `stepParameters` spelling; use
`kinematics`.

Use `stepParameterRuntime(stepParameterSource)` to turn the loaded parameter
source into the runtime object `buildModel` accepts.

### `common/cadScene.js`

```js
import {
  buildModel,
  fitCameraToModel
} from "cadgen-js/common/cadScene.js";
```

`buildModel(THREE, source, settings)` returns a model API:

```js
{
  source,
  meshData,
  root,
  modelGroup,
  edgesGroup,
  displayRecords,
  records,
  bounds,
  restBounds,
  radius,
  runtime,
  update(nextSettings),
  dispose()
}
```

`source` can be a `loadSource()` result or raw mesh data. The model owns the
Three.js object graph and its mutable state.

`bounds` follows the live pose — what lighting, the floor, shadows and clipping
need. `restBounds` is the same model at its ZERO pose, before a parameter, mate
or animation frame moved a record, and it is what a camera fit is grounded on so
that posing a model never re-frames it. A source that is itself a posed wrapper
over its own rest geometry (a robot description; see `poseUrdfMeshData`)
publishes `restBounds` on its mesh data and that value stands in.

Common settings:

- `theme`: normalized or raw CAD scene settings. Render passes none and supplies
  `materialSettings` instead.
- `displayMode`: `shaded`, `shaded_edges`, `transparent`, `hidden_edges`,
  `hidden_lines_removed`, `unshaded`, or `wireframe`.
- `edgeSettings`: display-owned CAD edge style. Themes do not own edges.
- `materialOverrides`: sparse explicit PBR overrides; authored PBR otherwise
  wins over studio material fallbacks.
- `scale`/`sceneScale`: CAD or robot scene scale.
- `selection`: internal selection/filtering state. `focus`, `refs`, and `hide`
  filter rendered parts before records are built. Viewer-only fields such as
  `selectedPartIds`, `hiddenPartIds`, and `showEdges` affect visual state.
- `clip`: normalized clip-plane settings.
- `stepParameters`: compiled kinematics runtime object, from
  `stepParameterRuntime()`.
- `parameterSetup`: set `false` to skip sidecar setup lifecycle calls.
- `renderPartsIndividually`: build per-part records instead of a whole mesh.
- `edgeRendering`: declarative edge rendering configuration.

Declarative screen-space edge rendering:

```js
buildModel(THREE, source, {
  edgeRendering: {
    mode: "screen-space",
    Line2,
    LineGeometry,
    LineSegments2,
    LineSegmentsGeometry,
    LineMaterial,
    wireframeEdgeColor: "#111827"
  }
});
```

The model keeps screen-space line material bookkeeping internal through
`runtime.screenSpaceLineMaterials` and `runtime.syncScreenSpaceLineMaterials()`.
Callers should not provide callbacks that create edge objects.

`model.update(nextSettings)` merges mutable settings, rebuilds geometry only
when needed, reapplies material/selection/clip/STEP parameter state, and returns
the same model API. `model.dispose()` releases model-owned scene objects and
STEP parameter cleanup hooks.

Source colors: a GLB's material base colors and its `COLOR_0` vertex attribute
both count as source colors (`lib/render/glbMeshData.js`). A vertex-colored
part renders on a white base so the ramp shows unmixed — an FEA result or scan
heatmap keeps its colors even when the file declares no materials at all — and
`overrideSourceColors` in material settings replaces both kinds with display
fills.
Package components carry no vertex colors; their coloring is the descriptor's
occurrence/component/face colors.

`fitCameraToModel(THREE, camera, bounds, options)` is the shared orthographic
camera framing helper used by interactive rendering.

### Display modes, CAD edges and geometry sharing

Canonical display modes are `shaded`, `shaded_edges`, `transparent`,
`hidden_edges`, `hidden_lines_removed`, `unshaded`, and `wireframe`. The
retired `rendered` and `solid` values fail with their replacements. Normal CAD
keeps authored albedo and opacity but applies the matte workbench PBR channels,
because its inspection scene has no reflection environment.
`resolveDisplayMaterialSettings()` applies the shared Original, Single color
and Color by part policy without app state.

**Scene geometry is the tessellator's INDEXED output.** A surf component's
`meshData` shares the tessellation's vertex, normal and index buffers by
reference (a decoded `.tess` cache entry is copied out of its one entry
buffer) and is never expanded per triangle corner.

**CAD edges are not a surface shader.** `surfMeshData.js` emits indexed line
segments (`cadEdgePositions` + `cadEdgeIndices` + `cadEdgeClassRanges`, from
the same tessellation's boundary polylines, ~1.5 bytes per surface triangle)
and `cadScene.js` draws them as ONE instanced screen-space line draw per
component (`cadEdgeInstances.js`): the instances are every (segment,
occurrence) pair, decoded in the vertex shader from a per-component segment
texture (32 B per drawn segment, cached on the component) and a per-set
instance texture (128 B per occurrence: matrix, colour, opacity, visibility,
highlight).

`cadInk.js` fixes one dark model-edge palette and nominal widths per class:
feature 1, tangent 0.65, seam 0.8, and degenerate 0 (hidden). Public
`display.edges` keeps only enabled/silhouette choices; grid settings keep only
enabled. Viewer and snapshots share the same grid spacing and fixed ink.
Appearance updates preserve model lighting, materials, class ink, geometry,
segment textures and occurrence slots; only the canvas and guides adapt.

A thickness is a FULL width in DEVICE pixels — every line shader normalises its
extrusion by the drawing buffer, never the CSS size, and the fragment stage
filters a box with a symmetric ±0.75 px kernel. Integrated coverage equals the
nominal width even for subpixel lines, and zero width has zero coverage. Both
line paths share the filter; antialiasing does not inflate thin lines or depend
on the framebuffer sample count.

Per-occurrence highlight, dim, hide, focus, exploded placement and selection
are slots in that texture, written by the same record passes
(`applyDisplayRecordTransform`, `applyPartVisualState`,
`syncRecordEdgeMaterials`) that drive a plain line object; highlighted
occurrences draw in a second pass at the highlight render order. A deformed
tube leaves its slot for private screen-space lines, one per drawn class, that
bend with the surface and preserve the same class weights and colours.
Basic-only hosts use separate per-class materials too, so appearance changes
retain private edge geometry and cannot recolour another scene's component.
GPU cost per component: two textures, one 4-vertex quad, two materials, one
draw call (+1 while any occurrence is highlighted).

**One upload per component.** Geometry built from a shared component is cached
on the component object (`part.sourceMesh`), never on the composed package
`meshData`: a package is re-composed on every progressive publish and LOD swap,
and every occurrence, publish and swap reuses the one upload. A publish of the
same model reaches the live scene through `api.update({ source })`, which
reconciles records by occurrence id — records already on screen keep their
mesh, materials, visual and deformation state and BVH; only new occurrences are
built and only departed ones disposed (ownership and disposal:
[resource-ownership.md](resource-ownership.md)). Effects that change vertex
positions or normals acquire writable attributes before deforming them;
material refreshes leave component data unchanged. This keeps large assemblies
from duplicating these buffers for display. Assemblies keep geometry in their
component buffers; they allocate no combined copy of all positions, normals and
indices. Rendering and section views visit the placed components directly, and
the Viewer accepts that component geometry.

### `common/renderModel.js`

Use this module for interactive browser canvases, including the docs hero.

```js
import { renderModel } from "cadgen-js/common/renderModel.js";
```

`renderModel(THREE, model, options)` returns an interactive viewport API:

```js
{
  THREE,
  model,
  renderer,
  scene,
  camera,
  ready,
  resize(),
  render(),
  start(),
  stop(),
  capturePng(),
  dispose()
}
```

Common options:

- `canvas`: existing canvas for the renderer.
- `hostElement`/`container`: element used for responsive sizing.
- `renderer`: caller-owned renderer. If omitted, one is created.
- `scene` and `camera`: caller-owned scene/camera. If omitted, defaults are
  created.
- `theme`/`themeSettings`: background and lighting settings.
- `alpha`, `antialias`, `powerPreference`, `preserveDrawingBuffer`,
  `logarithmicDepthBuffer`, `shadows`: renderer controls.
- `direction`, `up`, `padding`, `scale`/`sceneScale`: framing controls.
- `pixelRatio`, `maxPixelRatio`: output density controls.
- `autoResize`: set `false` to disable `ResizeObserver`.
- `autoStart`: set `true` to start an animation loop.
- `autoRender`: set `false` to prevent the initial render.
- `beforeRender({ deltaSeconds, viewport })`: per-frame hook for animation.
- `disposeModel`: set `false` when the caller will dispose the model.

`dispose()` stops animation, disconnects resize observation, removes the model
root from the scene, and disposes the created renderer/model unless ownership
was explicitly retained by options.

### `common/renderMeshScene.js`

Use this module for deterministic headless snapshot rendering.

```js
import {
  renderJobContext,
  modelOptionsForRenderJob,
  renderModel,
  captureModel,
  renderMeshJob
} from "cadgen-js/common/renderMeshScene.js";
```

`renderJobContext(meshData, job)` resolves the shared scene contract plus
snapshot-owned output policy: display, camera, quality, scene scale, outputs,
STEP topology edge visibility, and warnings. Snapshot scene quality comes only
from `render.quality`; `job.quality` contains technical tessellation only.

`modelOptionsForRenderJob(context, job)` converts that policy into
`buildModel()` settings.

Snapshot `renderModel(THREE, model, { job, context })` returns a headless
viewport:

```js
{
  THREE,
  model,
  scene,
  renderer,
  orthographicCamera,
  perspectiveCamera,
  context,
  sceneBuildStarted,
  ready,
  dispose()
}
```

This `renderModel` is intentionally separate from `common/renderModel.js`.
It uses snapshot sizing, studio environment, the shared stage floor/glow/shadow,
model-scaled lights with a fitted shadow frustum, canonical camera projection,
and deterministic renderer settings. Automatic perspective cameras fit the
current visible vertices to `output.padding` when `output.tightFrame` is true;
otherwise they fit the model bounds. An explicit camera position is never
reframed. Video capture fits its precomputed sequence-union bounds once so the
camera does not breathe between frames.

`captureModel(viewport, { job })` returns data only:

- `mode: "view"`: PNG data URLs in `outputs`.
- `mode: "section"`: PNG data URLs or SVG text in `outputs`.
- `mode: "list"`: part list and bounds.

It does not write files. The CAD skill snapshot CLI writes the returned data to
disk. Source checkouts use `packages/cadgen-js`; generated snapshot browser assets
bundle this entrypoint into cadgen's packaged runtime (`cadgen/_runtime/browser`).

`renderMeshJob(meshData, job)` is a compatibility wrapper that builds a context,
builds a model, renders/captures it, and disposes owned resources.

## Kinematics

Two names, two things, and they are not interchangeable:

* `kinematics` is the POSE INPUT — what `loadSource()` and the snapshot job
  packet take. A declared preset name, or direct DOF values:

  ```json
  { "drive": 180, "ringVisible": false }
  ```

  Animation envelopes (`animate`, `fps`, `durationSeconds`, `duration`, `loop`)
  are retired and throw: a still renders one frame at the given values.

* `stepParameters` is the compiled RUNTIME OBJECT that `buildModel()` takes,
  produced by `stepParameterRuntime(source.stepParameterSource)`.

`common/stepParameters.js` validates the pose values against the loaded
definition and normalizes defaults.
`loadSource()` uses it to populate `source.stepParameterSource`; callers then
pass `stepParameterRuntime()` into `buildModel()`.

## Examples

Interactive viewer/docs usage:

```js
import * as THREE from "three";
import { loadSource, stepParameterRuntime } from "cadgen-js/common/source.js";
import { buildModel } from "cadgen-js/common/cadScene.js";
import { renderModel } from "cadgen-js/common/renderModel.js";

const source = await loadSource({
  kind: "step",
  glbUrl: "/models/.part.step.glb",
  sourceSidecarUrl: "/models/part.step.json",
  cadPath: "models/part.step",
  kinematics: { drive: 180 }
});

const model = buildModel(THREE, source, {
  theme,
  displayMode: "shaded_edges",
  edgeSettings,
  stepParameters: stepParameterRuntime(source.stepParameterSource)
});

const viewport = renderModel(THREE, model, {
  canvas,
  hostElement: canvas.parentElement,
  theme,
  autoStart: true
});
```

Headless snapshot usage:

```js
import * as THREE from "three";
import { loadSource } from "cadgen-js/common/source.js";
import { buildModel } from "cadgen-js/common/cadScene.js";
import {
  captureModel,
  modelOptionsForRenderJob,
  renderJobContext,
  renderModel
} from "cadgen-js/common/renderMeshScene.js";

const source = await loadSource(job);
const context = renderJobContext(source.meshData, job);
const model = buildModel(THREE, source, modelOptionsForRenderJob(context, job));
const viewport = renderModel(THREE, model, { job, context });

try {
  const result = await captureModel(viewport, { job });
  // Write result.outputs in the CAD skill snapshot CLI or another caller-owned layer.
} finally {
  viewport.dispose();
}
```

## Ownership Rules

- Do not write files from shared render APIs. Return data to the owning CLI or
  application layer.
- Do not expose object-construction callbacks for edges. Use declarative
  `edgeRendering`.
- Keep STEP-only options explicitly STEP-named and reject them for non-STEP
  sources.
- Dispose viewports and models that you create.
- Prefer `loadSource -> buildModel -> renderModel -> captureModel` for new
  shared render code instead of loading assets or constructing render scenes
  inline.
