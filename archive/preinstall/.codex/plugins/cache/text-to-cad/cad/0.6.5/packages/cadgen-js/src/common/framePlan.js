// samples fall does not, and two derivations of "which moments of the clip" is
// exactly the pair that drifts by one frame and loops with a stutter.

/** The frame schedule a `{fps, seconds, start}` request implies over one clip.
 *
 * `seconds` defaults to the span the clip still HAS from `start`, and the frame
 * count is `seconds * fps` rounded, so the last frame sits one interval BEFORE
 * `start + seconds`. That is what makes a looping clip loop cleanly: the frame
 * at `start + seconds` is the frame at `start` again, and rendering both
 * stutters on every repeat.
 *
 * Every time is measured against the clip, because `evaluateAnimationClip`
 * ANSWERS a time past the end rather than refusing it: a non-looping clip
 * clamps, so the tail is one still image repeated, and a looping one wraps, so
 * it covers a different span than the one asked for. Both are exit-0 wrong
 * answers that nothing downstream can tell from a right one. */
