Usage:
  scripts/github-workflows/check-builds.sh [--skip-bundle-check]

Checks the production bundle layout. The generated runtime is not committed, so by
default this builds it first with scripts/bundle/bundle.sh --check. Use
--skip-bundle-check only after the current workflow has already run
scripts/bundle/bundle.sh --clean in the same checkout.

Options:
  --skip-bundle-check  Do not build the runtime; check what is already there.
  -h, --help           Show this help.

  #   - Skills CLI (npx skills): dereferences them into real files.
  #   - Claude Code plugin install: preserves them verbatim.
  #   - Codex plugin add: SILENTLY DROPS them. copy_dir_recursive in
  #     codex-rs/core-plugins/src/store.rs branches only on is_dir()/is_file(),
  #     and DirEntry::file_type() does not traverse symlinks, so a symlinked
  #     entry matches neither branch and never reaches the plugin cache. No
  #     error, no warning -- the file is simply missing at runtime.
  # A symlink that reaches the published tree therefore ships a broken skill to
