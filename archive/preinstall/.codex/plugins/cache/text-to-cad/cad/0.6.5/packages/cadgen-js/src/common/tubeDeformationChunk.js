// The tube/braid runtime's lazy boundary.
//
// tubeDeformation.js and the three modules under it (the GPU path, the braid
// material and their shared shader attributes) are ~29 kB of the client's
// initial chunk, and only one thing in the whole viewer can reach them: a
// document's embedded animation calling `deformTube` on a clip handle. Nothing
// else produces a deformation — a step module's effects only carry what an
// animation frame already put there — so a document with no `animation.source`
// can never need this code, and must never download it.
//
// The load therefore happens at the one async door every clip must pass
// through: `compileAnimationSource` in renderModule.js awaits it before a clip
// exists to be evaluated. Frame evaluation stays synchronous and sees a loaded
// runtime, so an animated tube renders exactly as it did when this was a static
// import — there is no first-frame rest pose and no dropped frame.
//
// `tubeDeformation()` answers null until then. Every caller outside the
// animation path (the scene's resets, the edge-line pass) is a no-op on a
// record that has no tube state, and a record can only acquire tube state after
// a deformation was applied, so `tubeDeformation()?.fn(...)` is exact rather
// than merely tolerant. `deformTube` itself, which cannot no-op, throws.
