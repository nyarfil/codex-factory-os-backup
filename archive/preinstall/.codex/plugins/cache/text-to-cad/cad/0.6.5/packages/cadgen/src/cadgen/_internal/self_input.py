"""A model must not declare one of its own outputs as a build input.

``read_step``, ``read_scene`` and ``declare_input`` put a file's content
hash in the model's closure. Pointed at a file the SAME model writes, that is
not a loop but an input that changes every time the model runs: the gate can
never say "current", every run is a full rebuild, and the geometry the model
produces depends on whatever the previous run happened to leave on disk. A
model whose body reads and re-wraps its own ``.step`` grows on every run and
exits 0 each time -- plausible-wrong output, which is the one outcome the
engine refuses to produce.

The skill reference states the rule ("Never ``read_step`` your own output ...
Input path and output path being different files is the whole rule"); this is
where it is enforced, at the two doors that record an input.
