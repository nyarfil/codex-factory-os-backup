"""No source file carries a NUL byte, so every source file stays greppable.

This shipped. A group-key sentinel in the GLB writer was written as the raw byte
``0x00`` instead of the escape ``\\0``, which turned
``packages/cadgen-js/src/lib/glb/writeGlb.js`` from UTF-8 text into a binary
file. The consequences are all silence:

* ``rg`` skips binary files, so every later search of the module that writes
  every GLB the product ships returned nothing — for a developer and for an
  agent alike, the code simply did not exist;
* ``grep`` prints ``Binary file ... matches`` and no line numbers;
* ``git diff`` renders the byte as a blank space, so the line reads as a
  harmless leading-space sentinel in review;
* bundlers escape it on the way out, so the packaged runtime is correct and no
  behavioural test can fail.

Nothing else in the suite can see it, which is why it is policy-checked here.
The fix is always to write the escape sequence the language already has, or to
pick a sentinel that is not a control character.
