"""The HTTP contract: both browser gates, route dispatch, and the SPA.

Security / trust model, unchanged from the Node backend: the server binds
loopback and serves UNAUTHENTICATED — the loopback bind is the trust boundary
against other processes and machines. Loopback is NOT a boundary against the
user's own browser, so two gates defend against that specifically:

* Host validation refuses a request whose Host names anything but
  127.0.0.1/localhost/::1 — the DNS-rebinding case, where an attacker domain
  re-resolves to loopback and the browser treats us as same-origin. Skipped when
  bound non-loopback, matching Jupyter's ``allow_remote_access``.
* Every POST requires an ``x-cadgen-viewer`` header. ``POST /__cad/artifact``
  compiles the target, and since all params ride the query string with no body,
  a cross-origin POST is otherwise a no-preflight "simple request". A custom
  header forces a preflight instead.

No ``Access-Control-*`` headers are served, deliberately: their absence is what
makes the same-origin policy block cross-origin reads and what makes that
preflight fail. Do not add them.

        paid for two full directory walks per build POST; this pays for one, and
