"""Name the blocker when Windows refuses to load the CAD kernel.

The kernel cadgen and build123d run on is ``OCP``, a single native extension
module (``OCP.cp3xx-win_amd64.pyd``, ~90 MB) that the cadquery-ocp wheels ship
WITHOUT an Authenticode signature. Windows 11's Smart App Control blocks
unsigned native code, so on a machine where it is on -- which is the default
state of a fresh install -- every command that imports the kernel fails with::

    ImportError: DLL load failed while importing OCP: ...

Nothing in that message says who refused the load, and the only record is
Event ID 3077 in the CodeIntegrity operational log. An agent that sees the
ImportError reinstalls, retries and gives up; a user who does find the event
still has to learn that Smart App Control has no per-app exception. So the
CLI failure reporter and ``cadgen doctor`` say all of that in the place the
failure is read.

The hint is deliberately narrow: a Windows ``ImportError`` whose message is
the loader's ``DLL load failed`` naming OCP. ``ModuleNotFoundError`` is a
missing install and already has its own hint; a failure on any other platform
is not this.
